 temujin.0001.t: "Hoofbeats at dawn"
 temujin.0001.desc: "Qo'aqchin, your maid, wakes you under the morning's yellow light, schreaming that "The Earth shakes! I can hear the sound of swift horses hooves! Are the Tayichi'ut approaching? Rise quickly!" Already, your small entourage is fleeing your camp at Bürgieri. You can see that your brothers, Jelme,  Bo'orchu, and your mother carrying your sister, have each taken one of your ten horses alongside a single spare. The rest are fleeing in their own ways."
 temujin.0001.a: "Flee to the mountain!"
 temujin.0002.t: "A narrow escape"
 temujin.0002.desc: "Throughout the day, you flee this way and that, through the sinking mud and dense woods surrounding Burqan-qaldun. Eventually, you start recognize your pursuers- the chiefs of the Three Mergid, [uduyit.GetTitledFirstName], [uwas.GetTitledFirstName], and [qaat.GetTitledFirstName], avenging your father's kidnapping of your mother from the prominent Mergid chief Chiledu.  You flee in utter terror along dotted elk tracks, alone but for your single horse, along dotted elk trails. But you know the mountain better then they do, and they are lost like glutted bears in the thickets, woods, and swamps.  When the enemy is satisfied with what they have taken and frustrated with their inability to catch you, they leave, and allow you respite, to take shelter by building a yurt of willow twigs. As night falls, some of your court meets again on the mountaintop.  In thanks to the mountain for its protection, you drape your sash round your neck, hang your hat from your arm, beat your chest with your hand, and pray, kneeling towards the sun nine times."
 temujin.0002.a: " Every morning I will sacrifice to Burqan-qaldun, and every day I will pray to it." 
 temujin.0003.t: "Reconnaisance and Revenge" 
 temujin.0003.desc: "You send Belgutei, Bo'orchu, and Jelme to find out whether the enemy had really left-and what they had taken. You learn that they are indeed returning home-but that they have kidnapped your maid Qo'aqchin,[sochigel.GetTitledFirstName], and your wife [borte.GetTitledFirstName]. While your hosts alone can not avenge him, perhaps with the support of your blood-brother [jamukha.GetTitledFirstName] and your Khan and adoptive father [toghril.GetTitledFirstName], you may get your vengeance." 
 temujin.0003.a: "I will take revenge!" 
 temujin.0004.t: "A vengeance taken!"
 temujin.0004.desc: "In early morning, you and your confederates, the Three Mergid, rode down the camp of Temujin, son of the kidnapper. Temujin himself escaped, but you found his maid smuggling away his wife as 'Sheep wool' in a black-covered ox-drawn carriage. While you pursued Temujin himself around the nearby mountain, you could not find him. At the end of the day, the three Mergid contented themselves with kidnapping his wife in exchange for his mother."
temujin.0004.a: "We have taken our revenge" 
 temujin.0005.t: "A vassal in need"
 temujin.0005.desc: "Temujin, son of your blood-brother who restored you to your tent, who pledged his allegiance to you with a glorious sable coat, has been raided by the Mergid. His wife has been kidnapped, alongside his brother's mother. You have promised him your aid in reuniting the Mongols; now, will you help him  avenge such a slight to him, and to your promises of protection?"
 temujin.0005.a: "I will crush the Mergids"  
 temujin.0005.b: "Sounds like a him problem"
 temujin.0006.t: "Toghril on the warpath"
 temujin.0006.desc: "Your liege [toghril.GetTitledFirstName] has replied to your request for aid against the Mergids, saying: 'When you brought me the sable jacket, you said that, in your father's time, your father and I swore brotherhood, and that I therefore am as a father to you. When you gave me the coat, I promised "In return for the sable jacket, I will unite your scattered people". I will stand by my words. In return for the Sable jacket, I will crush the Mergid and rescue Lady Borte for you. ""
 temujin.0006.a: "Thank you, my father."
 
 
temujin.0007.t: "Helping an old friend"
temujin.0007.desc: "Temujin, your friend, who at the age of 11 swore to be your anda, your blood brother,   has been raided by the Mergid. His wife has been kidnapped, alongside his brother's mother. He has sent his own brothers by birth with a message, crying that "My heart is broken. Are we not kin? How can we take revenge?" You have promised him eternal brotherhood; now, will you help him  avenge such a slight to him, and to your promises of protection?"
 temujin.0007.a: "Let us ride against the Mergids"  
 temujin.0007.b: "Sounds like a him problem" 
 temujin.0008.t: "A brother in blood and bloodshed"
 temujin.0008.desc: "Your blood-brother Jamukha has responded to your call to arms. He replies: "My heart aches, knowing that your bed is empty. Let us gain revenge by destroying the Merkits. Let us rescue Lady Borte. Let us avenge ourselves.\n I have made offerings to the long spear-tipped banner. I have beaten the rumbling drum of cattle-hide. I have mounted my swift grey horse. I have put on my  strong clothing. I have grasped my hilted sword. I have set my peach-bark arrow against the string. Let us battle to the death against the Uduyit-Merkits. Follow the Onon river to its source: let us meet there"."
 temujin.0008.a: "Men who are sworn brothers share one life" 
 temujin.0009.t: "A sack and a reunion"
 temujin.0009.desc: "You barge into the Tent of the Merkit chief at midnight, through the smoke-hole, break and knock down the door. The Merkits panick, fleeing downstream down the Sellenge river, pursued by your horsemen, who loot everything they leave behind, then the belongings they carry with as they flee. Your soldiers kill most of them. But you do not have your wife yet. In the light of burning yurts and the midst of panicking enemies, you cry "Borte! Borte!" From a fleeing cart, you see Borte and Qo'aqchin running towards you. They recognize your tether. By moonlight, you see the face of your bride. You have rescued her. "
 
 temujin.0009.a: "I have found what I sought"
temujin.0020.desc: "[usurper.GetTitledFirstName] has claimed to be Khan of the Mongols-a title you covet. You will bring him down."

temujin.0020.t: "Moon and Sun"
temujin.0030.t: "Ally, Brother, or Nephew"
temujin.0030.desc: "As [toghril.GetTitledFirstName]'s anda's son, you call them blood brothers, and yourself his son. Usually, that is in figurative terms as his vassal, but as you continue to win campaigns for him, people, him included, increasingly see you as his son in other ways, such as being his heir and successor.  "
temujin.0030.a: "Should not the greatest son succeed the father?"
temujin.0030.b: "Should not the greatest son succeed the father?"
vengeance_war: "War of vengeance"
senggum_jealousy.t: "Blood or Water"
senggum_jealousy.desc: "Temujin gave you oaths of submission,calling you father and him son. But as the years go on, and his carreer increasingly impresses and Senggum's increasingly doesn't, many wonder if your khanate will be willed to the eldest son of your wife's womb, or the son of your blood brother who calls you his father. As his case to rule becomes better, your son has become extremely concerned, and has begun reaching out to you. He urges you not to trust Genghis-even if he is granted rule willingly, he is not likely to let a rival claimant to power survive long. He might say 'father' and 'son'-but does he truly think so? "
senggum.a: "We cut ties, firmly but without trying anything more."
senggum_jealousy.b: "We will keep firm our friendship and alliance"
senggum_jealousy.c: "Senggum makes a point-but our alliance will not break so soon"

Senggum_jealousy: "Dashed hopes of succession"
