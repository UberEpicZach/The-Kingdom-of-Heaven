Upon our arrival at the gates, the party is greeted with the sight of a truly imperial city, worthy of the emperor's presence. \n\nConstruction on the newer district of Weisenau by the Rhine has yielded spectacular results! Merchants have already gathered, selling foreign wares to laborers, who indulge in dates and pastries. \n\n[stop_host_scope.GetCharacterViewName] greets me with a smile. "Wonderful job, my liege. Please, accept my gratitude for the funding of these works!""

  KOH_Pentecost.12.t:0 "Pentecost: A Reception"
  KOH_Pentecost.12.desc:0 "This afternoon, [GetTitleByKey('c_mainz').GetNameNoTier] is certainly abustle. Horse carts hailing from across the land bring lords and ladies, wares, and tales of far off places. \n\nAs tens of thousands of guests wander the narrow streets of the seat of the Archbishop’s domain, the whispering threat of plague is but a murmur in the back of the mind. Few are cynical enough to worry of pestilence when there are such delights at every turn. Scholars from across Europe have come to record the events, and miles of fluttering tents line the outside of the city walls. \n\nAll persons of status are received at the imposing St. Martin’s Cathedral; It is not long before a dispute breaks out! [SCOPE.sC('count_hainaut').GetCharacterViewName] has been offered the title of Swordbearer, but some argue he is not worthy of such an honor! [SCOPE.sC('duke_lorraine').GetCharacterViewName] has been presented as an alternative candidate for the role."

  KOH_Pentecost.13.desc:0 "The first segment of the Diet has been devoted to the promised concordat between [SCOPE.sC('pope').GetCharacterViewName] and myself. The major question that longs to be resolved by all attendees is the status of Matilda of Tuscany’s succession. The Pope wishes for ownership over Tuscany, and concession to other papal demands. \n\nWhile a great blow to the empire’s authority, conceding could end the long dispute between the Holy Roman Empire and her Church. \n\nA resolution seems unlikely to be made, unless one side concedes. My [chancellor.GetCouncilTitle], [chancellor.GetTitledFirstName], however, views this as an opportunity. He suggests proposing a compromise in which Tuscany remains imperial territory, but the Papacy receives two-tenths of Italy’s imperial revenue. He claims this would appease both parties."
  KOH_Pentecost.13.a:0 ""It is perhaps best we bend the knee...""
  KOH_Pentecost.13.b:0 "We shall attempt mediation."

  KOH_Pentecost.14.a:0 "Oh well."

  KOH_Pentecost.15.t:0 "Pentecost: An Unthinkable Prospect"
  KOH_Pentecost.15.desc:0 "It has been two years since the Lion of Saxony has stepped foot on German soil. [SCOPE.sC('lion').GetCharacterViewName] is an exile by my own hand, my disdained enemy, and now he stands before me once again. \n\nActing as an emissary for [SCOPE.sC('englishking').GetCharacterViewName], [lion.GetFirstName] views an alliance between England and the Holy Roman Empire to be mutually beneficial. There is a cost to this alliance; [SCOPE.sC('lion').GetCharacterViewName] expects his imperial ban to be lifted, and his Saxon territories returned!"
  KOH_Pentecost.15.a:0 "In the greater interest of the empire, I shall comply."
  KOH_Pentecost.15.a.tt:0 "Perhaps reconciliation is possible..."
  KOH_Pentecost.15.b:0 "Who does this fool think he is?"

  KOH_Pentecost.16.t:0 "Pentecost: Ecclesiastical Squabble"
  KOH_Pentecost.16.desc:0 "The delicacies are laid out upon the table in bounteous fashion. All varieties of Persian spices are passed around generously, alongside spreads smeared upon the freshest bread of the Rhine. Plums stewed in rose water; civets of hare covered in fine sauce... Cuts of meats are passed on by rank down the table, and yet the least of them still eat like kings, partaking in venison pie! Heavenly delights, surely, and yet some are not content to revel in the moment.\n\n[other_konrad.GetFirstName], the Abbot of [fulda.GetNameNoTier], demands the right to sit on my left, a privilege only usually granted to [phillip.GetFullName]. \n\n[SCOPE.sC('phillip').GetCharacterViewName] is in utter horror over this challenge. Is he not the most righteous among the imperial clergy? Now, they both look to me to sort this out."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.a:0 "The chair belongs to Cologne."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.a.tt:0 "Angering the Archbishop may prove to be a problem!"
  KOH_Pentecost.16.b:0 "Let the abbot sit where he pleases."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.b.tt:0 "The Abbot of Fulda is equal in status to the Archbishop of Cologne."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.c:0 "I am sure they can resolve this squabble themselves. I’m hungry!"
  KOH_Pentecost.16.c.tt:0 "You could eat an entire boar!"

  KOH_Pentecost.17.t:0 "Pentecost: Making a Scene"
  KOH_Pentecost.17.desc:0 "[SCOPE.sC('phillip').GetCharacterViewName] colored with shock. Bad enough that [SCOPE.sC('other_konrad').GetCharacterViewName] would dare challenge the stature of his position, but now His Imperial Majesty went along with the charade!

A great many gifts are bestowed upon demurring vassals, who wish not to appear avaricious, but are all secretly pleased. \n\nThis is followed by the beginning of the gyrum, in which the knights are to show their skill at swinging shields and banners while on horseback. The top five knights in the realm shall receive bountiful reward as well."
  KOH_Pentecost.18.a:0 "I shall participate, of course!"
  KOH_Pentecost.18.b:0 "I'd better watch from the stands."

  KOH_Pentecost.19.b:0 ""I've had quite enough, I think.""

  KOH_Pentecost.20.t:0 "Pentecost: Ingelheim"
  KOH_Pentecost.20.desc:0 "To end the games, a grand mêlée tournament, the most barbaric of all challenges, and yet the greatest tradition of them all, is to be fought at Ingelheim, near [GetTitleByKey('c_mainz').GetNameNoTier]. There have been reports from late arrivals of a brewing storm coming from Frankish lands. Many advise that the mêlée not continue, lest the priests make a fuss."
  KOH_Pentecost.20.a:0 "We will try our luck."

  KOH_Pentecost.21.t:0 "Pentecost: The Grand Mêlée"
  KOH_Pentecost.21.desc:0 "The weather is only slightly damp; the last of the three events has begun! Hand-to-hand combat is quite dangerous, but the pell-mell offers the greatest award of merit to those who can overcome the thousands of other participants!"

The common people follow the priests' warning, of course, and they say the games mustn't continue lest tragedy strike. Some spineless vassals have also been made content with the matter. \n\nTo have such a grandiose event canceled by nature... it would be deceitful to say I wasn't disappointed."
