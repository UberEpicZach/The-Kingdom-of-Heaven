 bm_jerusalem:0 "The Fall of Jerusalem"
 bm_jerusalem_desc:1 "After the downfall of the Fatimid and Zengid dynasties, a bloody succession and the heat of conflict has forged a new charismatic leader-- Saladin-- to unite the crumbling sultanates into one great empire. \n\nThe Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem sways at the weakest point in its 100 years. The Leper King is a dying man, and his vassals know it. Without children, Baldouin’s heir is his sister, Sibylla. Her husband, Guy de Lusignan, is a bloodthirsty man eager to be king. With King Baldouin indisposed, Jerusalem’s truce with Saladin is crumbling. The Templars and the armies of Oultrejordain plunder Muslim trade routes, giving Saladin the justification he needs for war..."

 bookmark_baud_desc:1 "While roughhousing with other boys, it was discovered that young Baudouin felt no pain. The Saracens say that leprosy is God’s vengeance against the vanity of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In spite of his illness, Baudouin became a scholar and a diplomat: a king who adroitly balances the fragile peace left by his father Amaury. Now as his health deteriorates, many of the powerful vassals of the kingdom agitate for a war they may not win. \n\n#bold In your weakened condition, can you defend the Kingdom of Heaven?#"

 bookmark_saladin_desc:0 "Salah ad-Din-- or Saladin-- is a Sunni Kurd who, despite his origin, deftly rose in the ranks of the Shiite Fatimid caliphate in Egypt, first becoming vizier by his own merit, then abolishing the Fatimids in favor of the Sunni caliphate in Baghdad. As Sultan of Egypt and Syria, Saladin founded his own dynasty. Now his Ayyubids control territory which winds around the sea, and Saladin has promised them the sparkling jewel of Jerusalem. \n\n#bold Are you prepared to clash with the Crusaders once more, and take the Kingdom of Heaven?#"

 bm_kings: "The Kings' Crusade"
 bm_kings_desc: "Western Europe lies restless. A scent of change is in the air. In England, the princes have allied with their mother in a bid to unseat the old lion-- and failed. Henry has lost his namesake, and must accept that his heir will be one of his rebellious younger sons. Aliénor, duchess of Aquitaine, once the queen of France and now the queen of England, languishes under house arrest. Prince Richard looks to his dearest friend, the newly king Philippe of France, to help secure his place in the English Succession. \n\nBut Philippe has troubles of his own. He has no spare brothers to take his place if he should die young. His queen, Isabella, is underage and of a fragile disposition; the people uproar when he threatens to dismiss her. Philippe dreams of unifying all Franks under the throne of France, but portions of his territories have been parcelled off by dowry. To forge his kingdom, he fights the treacherous dukes of Flanders and Brabant. \n\nTheir neighbors to the east are no more peaceful. Friedrich, king of the Germans and Holy Roman Emperor, has spent his life conquering. On the day he was made emperor, Rome rioted. His rule, though absolute in its thirty years, is not necessarily a popular one, but no one can say he is not capable of the task. He has built what he has through sheer force of will. Still, infighting from his own family plagues the HRE. \n\n#bold Fractured and divided, friends turned enemies, these kings will hear the call of the Kings’ Crusade in a few brief years. Will they be ready for Jerusalem?#"

 bm_byzantine: "The Byzantium Crisis"
 bm_byzantine_desc: "South-eastern Europe is a tinderbox, a spark away from conflict. \n\nThe Latins lie dead in Constantinople, massacred at the encouragement of Emperor Andronikos Komnenos. Among the dead is the regent empress, Maria of Antioch, and her son. The new emperor neglects affairs of state for more frivolous pursuits, raising taxes by day on the Bulgarian province to cover his nightly parties. \n\nMaria's brother-in-law, King Béla, finds himself in a difficult position. The Hungarians demand justice for the massacre, but Béla has been tied to Constantinople since he was a child, and swore to never make war on the Second Rome. \n\nWilliam of Sicily feels no such compunction, ready to avenge the dead Italians with a Norman invasion. Still, he must take precaution to not repeat the recent failure of Venice in tangling with the Byzantines. \n\nIn the east is Alania, which fends off raids from the hordes of Cumania. Prince Soslan is the chosen bridegroom of his cousin Tamar, the young queen of Georgia. Together the couple seek to extend the power of their union, to bring the region to an era of never before seen greatness."

#BYZANTINE CRISIS
 bm_reconquista: "The Reconquista"
 bm_reconquista_desc: "Iberia is balanced between the Muslims and Christians. In the north the Catholics divide the land between five Kingdoms: Portugal, León, Castile, Navarre, and Aragon. To the south, the Muslims are unified once more under the emergent Almohad caliphate. The Christians may have shifted the balance in their favor, however: the Almohad caliph is gathering for a new major campaign and has his sights on reclaiming Portugal.. Is this a time of opportunity and growth for the Christians, or can the new Almohad caliph muster enough strength to fight back?"

 bookmark_castille: "Alfonso "the Noble""
 bookmark_castille_desc: "Named King at the young age of two, Alfonso VIII has spent much of his reign stabilizing the kingdom of Castile following the early death of his father, Sancho III. Having to contend with unruly vassals, an ambitious uncle and the desperate King of Navarre, it is truly an achievement that the kingdom has not yet fallen. Yet Alfonso VIII remains resolute and believes that his efforts shall eventually be rewarded. Navarre still holds part of his kingdom, which it gained during his regency. His uncle vies for more just scraps of his land and his vassals remain an ever-present threat. However, in the following years, the fortunes of Castile would, indeed, be turned around and domination over the other Christian kingdoms of Iberia would be attained. \n\n#bold Will you see to it that this be done? Or will you instead focus your efforts on the Muslim threat?#"

 bookmark_leon: "Fernando II"
 bookmark_leon_desc: "The second surviving son of Alfonso VII of León and Castile, Fernando II remains an ambitious man. His reign as King has largely been spent on snubbing his nephew and snatching important territories from the kingdom of Castile, most prominently that of Toledo in 1162. However, in more recent years, the health of the King has declined and in 1180 an agreement of peace was made between the kingdoms of Leon and Castile. \n\n#bold Will you keep to the peace agreement or will you see Fernando II's ambitions of eclipsing Castile continued?#"

 bookmark_portugual_desc: "Called "the Conqueror" by his fellow Christians and "El-Bortukali" or "ibn-Arrink" by the Moors, Afonso I is the pre-eminent soldier king of his era. During his long reign, the Kingdom of Portugal was founded. During his reign numerous wars were fought against both Christians and Muslims alike and Afonso has surely distinguished himself. Yet now in the twilight of his life, many expect peace. Afonso himself knows better, for he knows the Moors well, having fought them all his life. Regardless, he is old and the kingdom shall soon pass to his son, Sancho. Perhaps one last war to break to truly break the Muslims for his son's reign to be prosperous shall be necessary? The King of Portugal is old, older than all of his fellow Monarchs in Iberia. Yet he is experienced and an able hand at war. \n\n#bold Will you make sure that the old King will see one last war or will you instead have the King spend his last years preparing the kingdom for his son in other ways?#"

During his reign, the influence and wealth of Aragon has reached a zenith. Many praise the King for his efforts and hope for a long reign to cement the house of Barcelona's hold over the kingdom. However, due to his marriage to Sancha, the sister to both the King of Castile and León, Alfons II seems poised to take part in any struggles between the two brothers, for better or worse. \n\n#bold Will you ensure the further ascension of the kingdom of Aragon, be it at the expensive of the other Christian kingdoms?

The Almohad Caliphate is experiencing a time of great progress religious reform under Yusuf's reign and many expect this to continue. Yet some still ask for the conquests to be continued, as they'd been left by the wayside for a decade since the early 1170s and the conquests of Valencia and Seville. \n\n#bold Shall you continue the conquests? The prime targets remain the infighting kingdoms of León and Castile, split as they are between bickering relatives.
