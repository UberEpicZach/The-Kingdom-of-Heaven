 bm_jerusalem:0 "The Fall of Jerusalem"
 bm_jerusalem_desc:1 "After the downfall of the Fatimid and Zengid dynasties, a bloody succession and the heat of conflict has forged a new charismatic leader-- Saladin-- to unite the crumbling sultanates into one great empire. \n\nThe Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem sways at the weakest point in its 100 years. The Leper King is a dying man, and his vassals know it. Without children, Baldouin’s heir is his sister, Sibylla. Her husband, Guy de Lusignan, is a bloodthirsty man eager to be king. With King Baldouin indisposed, Jerusalem’s truce with Saladin is crumbling. The Templars and the armies of Oultrejordain plunder Muslim trade routes, giving Saladin the justification he needs for war..."

 bookmark_baud_desc:1 "While roughhousing with other boys, it was discovered that young Baudouin felt no pain. The Saracens say that leprosy is God’s vengeance against the vanity of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In spite of his illness, Baudouin became a scholar and a diplomat: a king who adroitly balances the fragile peace left by his father Amaury. Now as his health deteriorates, many of the powerful vassals of the kingdom agitate for a war they may not win. \n\n#bold In your weakened condition, can you defend the Kingdom of Heaven?#"

 bookmark_saladin:0 "Salah ad-Din"
 bookmark_saladin_desc:0 "Salah ad-Din-- or Saladin-- is a Sunni Kurd who, despite his origin, deftly rose in the ranks of the Shiite Fatimid caliphate in Egypt, first becoming vizier by his own merit, then abolishing the Fatimids in favor of the Sunni caliphate in Baghdad. As Sultan of Egypt and Syria, Saladin founded his own dynasty. Now his Ayyubids control territory which winds around the sea, and Saladin has promised them the sparkling jewel of Jerusalem. \n\n#bold Are you prepared to clash with the Crusaders once more, and take the Kingdom of Heaven?#"

 bm_kings: "The Kings' Crusade"
 bm_kings_desc: "Western Europe lies restless. A scent of change is in the air. In England, the princes have allied with their mother in a bid to unseat the old lion-- and failed. Henry has lost his namesake, and must accept that his heir will be one of his rebellious younger sons. Aliénor, duchess of Aquitaine, once the queen of France and now the queen of England, languishes under house arrest. Prince Richard looks to his dearest friend, the newly king Philippe of France, to help secure his place in the English Succession. \n\nBut Philippe has troubles of his own. He has no spare brothers to take his place if he should die young. His queen, Isabella, is underage and of a fragile disposition; the people uproar when he threatens to dismiss her. Philippe dreams of unifying all Franks under the throne of France, but portions of his territories have been parcelled off by dowry. To forge his kingdom, he fights the treacherous dukes of Flanders and Brabant. \n\nTheir neighbors to the east are no more peaceful. Friedrich, king of the Germans and emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, has spent his life conquering. On the day he was made emperor, Rome rioted. His rule, though absolute in its thirty years, is not necessarily a popular one, but no one can say he is not capable of the task. He has built what he has through sheer force of will. Still, infighting from his own family plagues the HRE. His cousin, Heinrich the Lion, has never forgiven Friedrich for taking a crown that was not rightfully his. \n\n#bold Fractured and divided, friends turned enemies, these kings will hear the call of the Kings’ Crusade in a few brief years. Will they be ready for Jerusalem?#"

His best friends, the Plantagenets of England, are also his worst enemies. They have refused to return the dowry lands which ought to belong to France, and spurn the long understanding between his sister Alys and Prince Richard. Still, Philippe supports the rebellious sons of England against their father. \n\n#bold Will you find your moment, and claim what is rightfully yours?#"

#BYZANTINE CRISIS
 bm_byzantine: "The Byzantium Crisis"
 bm_byzantine_desc: "South-eastern Europe is a tinderbox, a spark away from conflict. \n\nThe Latins lie dead in Constantinople, massacred at the encouragement of Emperor Andronikos Komnenos. Among the dead is the regent empress, Maria of Antioch, and her son. The new emperor neglects affairs of state for more frivolous pursuits, raising taxes by day on the Bulgarian province to cover his nightly parties. \n\nMaria's brother-in-law, King Béla, finds himself in a difficult position. The Hungarians demand justice for the massacre, but Béla has been tied to Constantinople since he was a child, and swore to never make war on the Second Rome. \n\nWilliam of Sicily feels no such compunction, ready to avenge the dead Italians with a Norman invasion. Still, he must take precaution to not repeat the recent failure of Venice in tangling with the Byzantines. \n\nIn the east is Alania, which fends off raids from the hordes of Cumania. Prince Soslan is the chosen bridegroom of his cousin Tamar, the young queen of Georgia. Together the couple seek to extend the power of their union, to bring the region to an era of never before seen greatness."
