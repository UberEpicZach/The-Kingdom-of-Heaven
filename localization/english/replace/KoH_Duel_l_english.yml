 KoH_duels.3.t: "A Challenger Approaches"
 KoH_duels.3.d: "The proclamation in my hands is a curious thing. To think that such a frail piece of parchment could contain so dramatic a challenge! It goes on and on with the usual diplomatic speil, but ends with a simple message: "And so, you are challenged to a duel, a deadly combat that shall finally resolve our disputes with the most final of endings. Know that if you refuse this challenge, you refuse your honorable standing and status in the eyes of my court. I await an answer forthwith." When I look up, the entirety of the court is clustered around me, expectant for an answer."
 KoH_duels.3.a: "I shall accept this offer."
 KoH_duels.3.b: "I cannot beat them."

 KoH_duels.4.t: "The Duel"
 KoH_duels.4.d: "Finally, the hour of the duel has arrived. My opponent is pacing back and forth among their supporters, though whether they pace from worry or from anticipation is unclear. An armsmen hands me my blade and bows. "Your victory is assured, my liege." Suddenly, I feel less sure. Duels are always dramatic when watched from afar, but up close the tension is palpable. I turn, and gift the crowd a final statement."
 KoH_duels.4.a: "They will fall to my blade!"
 duel_can_go_either_way: "The die is cast."

 KoH_duels.5.t: "The Duel"
 KoH_duels.5.d: "Finally, I catch my opponent's blade with an armored fist and wrench it from their hands, a move only made possible by dint of their inexperience with my techniques. Well, and a bit of foolish bravado. I had them on the back foot for most of the duel, and this final move has firmly secured my victory. My opponent drops to their knees in front of me and hangs their neck. "You have bested me. I ask only for my life.""
 KoH_duels.5.a: "Well fought."
 KoH_duels.5.b: "I shall give you no mercy."

 KoH_duels.6.t: "The Duel"
 KoH_duels.6.d: "It feels like hours have passed since me and my opponent crossed blades. They have dealt me humiliation after humiliation and I haven’t been able to land so much as a nick. Despite my best efforts, they will kill me if I allow the fight to continue. The worst part is that they know this too. Mustering the last of my energy, I aggressively push out of the corner I have been forced into and throw myself toward the center of the fighting ring. I cast my sword aside, fall to my knees and swallow my pride. Already, I can hear the crowd laughing."
 KoH_duels.6.a: "I yield!"

 KoH_duels.7.t: "The Duel"
 KoH_duels.7.d: "My opponent fights like a cornered beast, but I have finally begun to wear down their defences! I attack again and again, slowly forcing them to the edge of the surrounding crowd, and I see panic begin to take over their features. One final strike, and...! Oh. A sudden stabbing pain shoots through me, and as I am forced to my knees the blade in my chest fills my vision, until all I can see is the gleaming steel. That, and my opponent's smiling face. "Idiot.""
 KoH_duels.7.a: "No!"
