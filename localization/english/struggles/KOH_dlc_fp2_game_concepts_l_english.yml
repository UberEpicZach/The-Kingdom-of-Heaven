 game_concept_struggle_desc:2 "$game_concept_struggle_struggles$ are long-term conflicts involving large [struggle_region_regions|E] with many [faiths|E] and [cultures|E]. Within the boundaries of a $game_concept_struggle$, peculiar special rules and [modifiers|E] may take effect, changing over time. Since they last decades to centuries, not all [characters|E] in a $game_concept_struggle$ are at [war|E] with each other all of the time.\n\nEach $game_concept_struggle$ consists of multiple [struggle_phase_phases|E]. As $game_concept_characters$ within the [struggle_region|E] act (e.g., declaring $game_concept_war$, or [marrying|E]), they may activate [struggle_catalyst_catalysts|E] that progress them between the different $game_concept_struggle_phase_phases$.\n\nDepending on the degree to which they're seen to be a part of the $game_concept_struggle$ by other participants, $game_concept_characters$ with [land|E] in the area may be seen as [struggle_involved|E], [struggle_interloper_interlopers|E], or [struggle_uninvolved|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_guelph_ghibelline:1 "The Guelphs and the Ghibelline Struggle"
 game_concept_struggle_guelph_ghibelline_desc:2 "The $game_concept_struggle_guelph_ghibelline$ depicts the centuries of fractious relationships across Italy under the Holy Roman Empire. Though born of the [investiture|E] Controversy in the previous century, the [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of hate-fueled violence, political schemes, house feuds, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies in such a situation, with various betrayals and back-stabs across the two factions in Italy."

 game_concept_struggle_guelph_phase_neutral:1 "Neutral Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_guelph_phase_neutral_desc:2 "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Peasantry and nobility alike are comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_hostility:1 "Hostility Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_hostility_desc:2 "Tensions flare and tempers fray in this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$. Repeated acts of malice and escalated misunderstandings during  the [struggle_guelph_phase_neutral|E] have lead to rising hatred of [characters|E] with differing [cultures|E], [faiths|E], or #EMP worse#!: both.\n\nSuch bloodshed cannot persist forever, though. Eventually, either cooler heads or simple exhaustion bring the peninsula to the [struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_peace|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_peace:1 "Peace Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_peace_desc:2 "Whether through sickness with the strife of the [struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_hostility|E] or deft escalation during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], the $game_concept_struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_peace$ represents a growing accommodation between the peoples of Iberia. Differences fall by the wayside and shared history and heritage binds former foes together.\n\nThe peninsula stands at a cross-roads: if conflicts reappear, then the [struggle_guelph_phase_neutral|E] awaits."

#  game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation:1 "Conciliation Phase"
#  game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation_desc:1 "The product of a notable [struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_peace|E], during this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, relations between the peoples of Iberia grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse. Inter-[faith|E] [marriages|E] are particularly common.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [struggle_guelph_ghibelline|E] back around to the [struggle_phase_guelph_Ghibelline_peace|E]."
