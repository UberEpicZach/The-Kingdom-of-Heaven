 temujin.0001.t: "Hoofbeats at dawn"
 temujin.0001.desc: "Qo'aqchin, your maid, wakes you under the morning's yellow light, schreaming that "The Earth shakes! I can hear the sound of swift horses hooves! Are the Tayichi'ut approaching? Rise quickly!" Already, your small entourage is fleeing your camp at Bürgieri. You can see that your brothers, Jelme,  Bo'orchu, and your mother carrying your sister, have each taken one of your ten horses alongside a single spare. The rest are fleeing in their own ways.   "
 temujin.0001.a: "Flee to the mountain!"
 temujin.0002.t: "A narrow escape"
 temujin.0002.desc: "Throughout the day, you flee this way and that, through the sinking mud and dense woods surrounding Burqan-qaldun. Eventually, you start recognize your pursuers- the chiefs of the Three Mergid, [uduyit.GetTitledFirstName], [uwas.GetTitledFirstName], and [qa'at.GetTitledFirstName], avenging your father's kidnapping of your mother from the prominent Mergid chief Chiledu.  You flee, alone but for your single horse, along dotted elk trails in utter terror,  circling thrice the sacred mountain. But you know the mountain better then they do, and they are lost like glutted bears in the thickets, woods, and swamps.  When the enemy is satisfied with what they have taken and frustrated with their inability to catch you, they leave, and allow you respite, to take shelter by building a yurt of willow twigs. As night falls, some of your court meets again on the mountaintop.  In thanks to the mountain for its protection, you drape your sash round your neck, hang your hat from your arm, beat your chest with your hand, and pray, kneeling towards the sun nine times."
 temujin.0002.a: " Every morning I will sacrifice to Burqan-qaldun, and every day I will pray to it." 
 temujin.0003.t: "Reconnaisance and Revenge" 
 temujin.0003.desc:"You send Belgutei, Bo'orchu, and Jelme to find out whether the enemy had really left-and what they had taken. You learn that they are indeed returning home-but that they have kidnapped [qo'aqchin.GetTitledFirstName],[sochigel.GetTitledFirstName], and your wife [borte.GetTitledFirstName]. While your hosts alone can not avenge him, perhaps with the support of your blood-brother [jamukha.GetTitledFirstName] and your Khan and adoptive father [toghril.GetTitledFirstName], you may get your vengeance. 
 temujin.0003.a: "I will take revenge!"
