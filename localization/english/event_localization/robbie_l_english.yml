robbie.0001.desc:1 "A curiosity from the occident has beseeched my attention; his words stand before me upon weathered parchment. A fervent crusader knight, one Robert, presents before me a request to desert to my court, claiming to have seen the way of our god and the wrongdoings of his companions. The courier stares impatiently, and puts in a good word for him, expressing the martial feats of the young Englishman."
robbie.0001.a:0 "Extend my invite to Robert to be a commander in my forces."
robbie.0001.b:0 "A Templar spy, surely."
