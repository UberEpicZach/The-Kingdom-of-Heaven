 richard.bride.t:0 "A Bride for Prince Richard"
 richard.bride.desc:0 ""The matter is settled," declares my father, King Henry, jabbing a meaty finger into the table. "This was decided when Alys was a wee chit. The princess has no defects. Indeed, she is comely and well-shaped." \n\nI grimace at the lecherous quality of his voice. The girl he speaks of is Princess Alys, sister to the King of France, my… Philippe. In a quiet corridor, Philippe laughs at me. "Pick a woman and marry her. I did it; it is not so hard. Better still, pick a girl who does not yet know her own mind. My sister will be pliable enough." \n\nThis pains me. "It is not so simple." \n\n"Is it not? Oh, do not sulk.""

 richard.bride.2.desc:0 "Alys and I have been betrothed since her infancy. We have always been friends, and understand one another. But I have heard whispers that my father has taken her to his bed. Worse, that she has given him a stillborn. \n\nMy mother, from behind locked doors, offers me a second choice. A princess of Navarre, said to be pious and sweet. But Philippe will be hurt if I reject his sister."

He looks so gloomy that I must cheer him. I say, "Pick a woman and marry her. I did it; it is not so hard. Better still, pick a girl who does not yet know her own mind. My sister will be pliable enough." \n\nNow I’ve wounded him.  "It is not so simple," he sighs.\n\nThere are things we must not speak. I laugh nervously. "Is it not? Oh, do not sulk.""

How long can you expect to play this game?" \n\nMy heart is light, as though an enormous burden has been lifted from my shoulders. "I have a natural son. I called him Philip. One son is enough for me, enough for England." \n\nHe runs his fingers over my lips. "I know too well the burden of being an only son. A bastard will have it twice-worse, even one so handsomely named.""

How long can you expect to play this game?" \n\nThe corner of his mouth tilts in a smile. "I have a natural son. I called him Philip. One son is enough for me, enough for England." \n\nI run my fingers over his lips, surpressing a flash of jealousy. Is it for the son I so need, or for the woman who has borrowed my place in his bed? "I know too well the burden of being an only son. A bastard will have it twice-worse, even one so handsomely named." \n\n"You know how I feel.""

 balian.women.1.t:0 "The Woman"
 balian.women.1.desc:0 "It is hard to believe that all this land is mine, barren desert though it may be. In France, I was modestly comfortable, and never thought to seek more than what was mine. My natural father was a bastard, and I am his, yet the people in Ibelin seem willing to have me as their lord. I think of Godfrey’s words: "A man who in France had not a house, is, in the holy land, the master of a city."  I am still making sense of all of this when hounds excitedly herald the arrival of riders. \n\nThe stranger on a white horse is a woman, billowing in a silk cloak in a color somewhere between red and yellow. I have never seen its like before, nor a creature such as this. Every one of her fingers is adorned with a jeweled ring worth a year of my labor. She is flanked by armed guards. \n\n"Where is your master?" she asks. \n\n"I have none." \n\nA demand follows: "Give me some water." \n\nCertainly she would not cross the desert without carrying her own supply. This is some test, I think, of my hospitality."

 balian.women.4.t:0 "The Lonely Queen"
 balian.women.4.desc:0 "In the hall outside the king’s chambers, I am greeted by an unexpected sight. Toy soldiers stand in a long line across the marble tiles. I follow the trail through the antechamber, curious to see the outcome of this great battle. At the end of the sprawl I discover the crown prince, Sibylla’s son, patiently indulged by a strawberry-haired girl. \n\nBeyond a thin curtain, seated alone, is a woman with that same unusual hair color, intensified by the bronze of her skin and the flattering color of her gown. There is an open book in her lap, unread, as she listens to the children play. Our eyes meet suddenly; I wince apologetically, caught staring. She smiles and beckons me closer. \n\nA breeze ruffles the curtains and the edges of her skirt. "You are the new lord of Ibelin, I think. I am sorry for the loss of your father. Godfrey was a good man." She has an accent, something like one I heard on my travels to Jerusalem. Not Italian. Greek? \n\n"Forgive me, I do not know all the members of the court."\n\n"I am called Maria." \n\nOh no. "Your Majesty," I say quickly, remembering to bow. No one has instructed me on what to do if I should meet the late king’s widow. No one warned me she was young and distractingly beautiful. \n\nShe laughs gently. "No, no. They mustn’t hear you call me that. His Majesty would hate it.""

 balian.women.4.a.tt:0 "You investigate the mystery."
 balian.women.5.t:0 "The Lonely Queen"
 balian.women.5.desc:0 "I uncover the tale of the two queens of Jerusalem. The mother of King Baudouin and Princess Sibylla still lives, put aside most cruelly in fear that her brother in Acre would usurp the crown. King Amaury chose a new wife at random, offering an alliance with whichever neighbor could provide a comely wife. In lieu of an answer, a ship arrived from Constantinople, carrying the lady and her attendants. \n\nIt is unfortunate that she gave the king a daughter before his passing. A son would have cemented her position in Jerusalem. The dowager can no more return to the empire than she can live among the step-children who despise her. She is like me, a stranger thrust into this strange world. \n\nI slide quietly into the palace library, intending to find a book on the language of the Greeks. Or perhaps I am looking for her? My footsteps hasten when I catch sight of the queen in an alcove. \n\n"My lord Ibelin, you have come back.""

"The Courtenays," she says apologetically, "have taken Isabelle from me once. I fear they may succeed again." \n\nThat must be a misery. "Have you spoken to the king?" \n\nShe sighs. I take this to mean the king is aware of these maneuvers. His silence speaks his approval of his mother’s games. "My daughter is all I have in this world. His Majesty is my lord in all matters." \n\nI could change that. I have the ear of the king. My fingers brush the edge of her skirts on the bench beside me. I am so close but I cannot--"

Sibylla presses a cool cloth to my dirty face. My skin tingles at her touch. I catch her arm. She has a husband! \n\n"This isn’t adultery, it's washing," she admonishes with a smile.

When I close my eyes at night, my heart still aches, but for a different face."

Maria rests her hands on the stone railing, enjoying the night air. \n\nMy fingers slide along the edge of her sleeve, down down until I am touching her bare fingers. The simple act of touch burns through my veins. "Command me to stop and I will," I whisper, stroking her hair back behind her ear with my other hand. "Command me." \n\nHer eyes flutter shut and I hear her breath hitch. "If I do not?" \n\n"You must take this for my confession, and be my absolution." I kiss her. We are alone.

Will you defend my nephew when he is king?" \n\n"Whatever you ask, I will serve." \n\n"No, hear it all before you answer," Baudouin snaps. This is the first time I have heard him raise his voice above a tepid whisper. "Would you marry my sister Sibylla were she free of Guy de Lusignan?" \n\nI swallow. "And Guy?" \n\n"He would be executed," Tiberias says bluntly. \n\nAm I the sort of man who would kill another to claim his wife?"

He says nothing in reply, but gestures for me to make my opening move. I push a pawn into place. My throat feels dry. There is a goblet laid for me. "It is my understanding that I must.. petition you if I wish to court someone within your family." \n\nThe king’s bandaged hand hovers over the board. "We had heard something of this."

 balian.women.18.desc:0 "The palace hears a rumor of the death of our ally, Godfrey. The old knight once had four children, but the last of these has passed on. Will Ibelin and Ramla pass on to his granddaughter, the Princess of Galilee? That would put a smile on old Tiberias’s face; his wife’s holdings seat him in wealth and comfort. Every bit he takes makes him that more likely to push for my brother’s throne, were he not so loyal to Baudouin. My husband, Guy, argues that the lands are part and parcel to Jaffa, and should therefore return to his domain. \n\nEach man presents his case before my brother. The Lady Eschiva is the daughter of the eldest daughter, and in another place would be disqualified by her sex. But this is Jerusalem! My brother reminds Tiberias that his wife has cousins, children of a son of Godfrey, who ought to be considered. Guy takes his turn before the court just as a whisper breaks out. Someone new has come to Ibelin. A son! Born in France and knighted at his father’s deathbed. I cannot resist such a ridiculous rumor. I run for the stables before my lords can scold me. \n\nThe ride to Ibelin is longer than I anticipated. The holding there is in a sorry state; hardly the home for a baron from France. France! There has been no one new at court for so long! I hardly knew how bored I was. My throat is parched long before we enter the courtyard. \n\nIn the center of the hubbub of baying hounds stands a slim man, looking lost. "Where is your master?" I ask. \n\n"I have none." For all the world he looks like a startled animal. I flatter myself to think I have that effect on him. \n\n"Give me some water." \n\nHe offers me a ladle."

He is quiet, and clear, but he has a touch of amusement in his eyes. My husband thinks very little of him, and complains in private. My brother takes to him immediately. \n\nI am curious. I cannot put him out of my mind. One day, I gather my ladies and my servants and we venture to Ibelin. I dress as if I am one of them, and prepare him a bath of rosewater. How surprised he is to find me waiting for him! "This isn’t adultery, it’s washing," I smile. "If it were adultery-- which it isn’t-- the Commandments are not for people like us.

Little Baudouin is as beautiful as his namesake, and sometimes I wonder if he will be just as fragile. My son has a favorite spot on my lap; he curls up just like a kitten. This is the way Guy finds us one afternoon. I can smell another woman’s perfume clinging to his skin. "These rooms are not yours," I say softly, not wishing to disturb the boy. \n\n"One day I will be the husband I was commissioned to be," he smirks, confident as always. \n\nOnce I loved this man. "Perhaps not, my dear." My brother wants us to be rid of him. \n\n"Your lover has a hundred knights, and the love of the king. I have the largest force in the kingdom. And the support of the Templars. I can do without the king’s affection. But as for your love--" I pull away from his touch. He looks disappointed. "Then we must come to an understanding.

But my mother despises the match, not the least of which for robbing her family of Isabella's funds. She complains to me that the Blois should be made whole for the 'theft'. I love my mother. Her complaints are so tiresome I consider getting rid of the girl just to quiet her. \n\nI need a son. God knows I need one more than any king in Christendom. My queen of four years is still a child in the shape of her narrow hips. They tell me a baby will kill her at her tender age. I think God must make an exception for me. \n\nThe queen's uncle, the Duke of Flanders, refuses me part of her dowry, claiming it was not his brother-in-law's land to give. The cur! I demand what is mine for the trouble of keeping his niece. Some months ago, Flanders' faithless wife died; again he refused to return her dowry to House Vermandois. The late duchess's sister, Éléonore, promises me her family's continuing love if I add her claim to my war. \n\nI make inquiries, none too quietly, about repudiating Isabella. I draw together a council in the town of Sens. I can barely hear the priests over the sound of a commotion in the churchyard. Outside, the people wail and shout, and in the center of this madness is a tiny woman dressed in sackcloth and ashes. They prostrate themselves before her bare feet, touch her hem and pray, as though a saint passes in their midst. I am shocked when I recognize the penitent is my queen!"

 flemish.war.2.desc:0 "I fly into a rage, slamming my fist against a wooden bench. My uncle, Robert, rushes to my side. His words are clipped, but ever practical: "You cannot be rid of her now, Philippe. Listen to the mob howl their devotion." \n\n"Flanders has coached her into this charade. I will cut off her letters. She will never be his agent again." \n\n"Take it out on him on the field," Robert suggests. "Lock her in a tower if you must. But never let a whiff of rumor pass into the public. You mustn't lose the claim on her dowry now.""

 flemish.war.3.t:0 "The Dowry War"
 flemish.war.3.desc:0 "I knew she was witty, but I never recognized my wife for such a clever creature. A smile rises upon my lips, and I pass along an invitation to have her visit to my quarters in Sens. She arrives dressed simply, but scrubbed clean of her theatrical ash. Her ears are veritably red from the effort. I see that she is trembling like a fawn, though no fear shows on her face. \n\nI stare at her for a minute, letting the tension grow. Still, she does not break. Then I allow her a soft, "Well done, my dear.""
