 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.t:0 "The Lion in Winter"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.d:0 "My brother Henry is no more. Strange to think of it. Just last summer, we were locked in a skirmish against one another, he on the side of our father, and I championing our mother's righteous cause. The flux took him-- a miserable death I would not wish on an enemy, let alone a beloved brother. \n\nOnce, we both stood against our father, in the days when the king refused him his independence. Our mother paid the price for us, then as now. I wonder if it broke you, brother, to love both sides? It wounds me, but perhaps not as grievously. Your friends campaign to name you a saint. I do not doubt you were the best of us. But I have no more time to ruminate in dark corridors and count the threads of your face in our tapestries. Aquitaine is my domain now, by our mother's will. My granaries are running dry; my men exhausted and my defenses in ruin. I must see to my home."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.a:0 "We shall rebuild!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.t:0 "News from Paris"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.d:0 "A frantic messenger delivers unto me a missive from Paris. I recognize Philippe's hand from the start. He writes to say that my brother Geoffrey fell from his horse during a joust-- and has been trampled to death. On the journey, I think my father will be quick to move on Brittany, but I am closer. \n\nConstance dryly tells me that the king of France tried to hurl himself into her late husband's grave, and had to be restrained by his courtiers. She is round with child, but her eyes are dry. Good, I think. God has given her the strength to govern her kingdom. My half-sister, Marie, is by her side.\n\nI find Philippe inconsolable in his chambers, drinking and weeping openly. "Geoffrey," he slurs, "was my dearest friend." I try not to take offense. "He was here for me, Richard. The cursed tournament was just an excuse for us to meet. He came to me, and told me that he believed that Brittany belonged with France. I will honor his desire." \n\n"A convenient last wish, as far as wishes go," I remark, offering him a fresh handkerchief. It is hard to see if he is lying through the show of hysterics."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.a:0 "And then, there were two..."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.t:0 "Prince Lackland"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.d:0 "Father has legitimized John, my youngest kin, as his successor, his favorite child. The boy, who has barely ever seen battlefields, let alone lead armies or held titles, will be crowned king, over me. \n\nPerhaps it was expected, since John has always been loyal as a dog to him. Perhaps, this has been my doing, having crossed swords with him several times over the years. But he must understand why I opposed him. I have only ever done so when he would try to take from me what was rightfully mine. Is it not expected of a king? He must see that. I hope."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.a:0 "I must proceed carefully... and reconcile with father."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.b:0 "I am the rightful heir. I must find allies!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.t:0 "A Little Place in France"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.d:0 "The sanctions on my domain are increasing by the day. Earlier I had hoped that perhaps Father had proclaimed John as his successor to command action from me. But now it is becoming increasingly clear he has no affection for me left in his heart.\n\nAquitaine was entrusted to me by Mother in her absence. I have earned the loyalty of its people by defending it countless times. And I have made the right to call it mine. How can he command me to concede this land to John?"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.a:0 "By right of Aliénor, Aquitaine is mine!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.t:0 "The Odds"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.d:0 "Though I do not wish it, it seems inevitable that I will have to go to war against father. Father’s acquisition of Brittany bore fruit. Brittany and Normandy are directly under his control, and will rally their forces to him. \n\nAdvisors have urged me to write to the king of Scotland, but I am hesitant. William supported us when we rebelled against our father; this alliance led him to heavy losses in land and possessions. As I am mostly dependant on my forces of Aquitaine, Anjou and Poitiers, it may be necessary to seek more aid."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.a:0 "Look for more supporters?"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.a.tt:0 "You send an urgent letter north."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.t:0 "A Clash of Pride"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.d:0 "I have heard a rumour that soldiers have been sighted moving in large numbers in Brittany. They bear my father’s banners. \n\nCould he be preparing to attack me? Or is it a form of provocation? Perhaps, if I attack before they entrench in their forts, I could catch his troops in disarray. \n\nBut it is never so simple. Father is a great military tactician, and these rumours could have been his own doing."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.a:0 "A lion moves first and fast."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.a.tt:0 "You start a war with England."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.b:0 "Rumors are just rumors. Let him attack first if he dares."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.b.tt:0 "You wait to see if Henry makes the first move."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.t:0 "The Call"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.d:0 "Desperate letters flood in from the east. The Holy Kingdom of Jerusalem has fallen to Saracen forces lead by the mighty Saladin. The Pope calls for all knights bound by the oath of Christendom to prepare for a Crusade. I, too, am eager to answer this summons. \n\nBut only I stand between Aquitaine and England. If I travel the Via Francigena, Anjou will inevitably fall, and I will never be able to return home."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.a:0 "Glory to God! We shall travel to the Holy Land!"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.b:0 "I cannot leave Aquitaine alone and undefended."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.t:0 "Aliénor"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.d:0 "I have chosen to stay behind and protect my lands. But it seems father had anticipated me and already prepared for such a decision. Henry has released Aliénor, the rightful Duchess of Aquitaine, and sent her to me. She has her own schemes to play against Father, for which, she needs control of these lands."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.a:0 "But Mother... you gave these lands to me!"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.b:0 "This place was always hers."


 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.t:0 "The Duke of Anjou"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.d:0 "With Aquitaine returned to Mother, Anjou, the ancestral homeland of my father, is my last foothold. My alliances are being held together by threads. \n\nI am left with only two options. Either I reconcile with father, or find a powerful new ally. \n\nPhilippe has always held contempt for my father. Our relationship has been... complicated, as of late. But perhaps he will agree to ally with me in the name of Geoffrey’s wife and children."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.a:0 "I will write to Paris."
  KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.b:0 "Father knows best..."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.t:0 "A Letter for Philippe"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.d:0 "Philippe, \n\nThis letter bears a grave importance. Ever since I received the news of Geoffrey’s untimely passing, I have tried to ensure the safety of his family. But my father has made doing so difficult for me; first, through the occupation of Brittany, second, by the subsequent capture of Geoffrey’s widow. \nIt is only through rumors and informers that subsequently I came to know of Arthur, my young nephew, the only son of your bosom friend. One can only imagine the hardships the mother and son must have been through in this cruel captivity. \nPhilippe, join me once more. Help me free my nephew and his mother from Henry. \n\nYours evermore, \nRichard"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.a:0 "War it is."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.t:0 "Philippe's Reply"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.d:0 "My Dear Richard, \n\nI was so moved by your concern for Constance and little Arthur. Geoffrey was a dear companion, and each day they spend in captivity is a betrayal of his memory. Words cannot express the joy I feel to find an ally in a common cause. \nBut as you may know, I have fought righteously on many fronts in the years since I have become king. It has taken its toll on my royal treasury, dear friend. The people would be stretched to provide for another foreign war. Therefore, if I am to help you in your righteous cause, you must provide me, in return, a total sum of 1000 crowns, so that I may be able to take care of the children of my empire. \n\nIn Devotion, \nPhilippe \n\nEver so clever, my friend. We both know this coup will have little to do with Constance and Arthur. But, so be it!"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.a:0 "War it is."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.t:0 "Peace at Last"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.d:0 "It is done. The war is won and Father has accepted me as his successor. Philip will be paid his promised sum and I shall succeed as the king of England. \n\nBut now another duty awaits me, one that I have delayed for too long: a call for aid from Holy Land. \n\nMy father and Philippe have agreed to provide me support on my expedition. However, Father suddenly seems fragile to me."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.a:0 "Must I worry about his health?"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.14.t:0 "Richard's Coronation"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.14.d:0 ""Good people of England and my dear friends! Lately we have had very troubled times. But they are behind us now! As you entrust me with this duty on this day, let me make a promise to you. I swear to you, that under my rule, this land shall finally have peace."" \n\nI see them bow to me now, but I know well enough how many of them actually mean it. Father’s loyalists will not turn to my side so easily. Soon I will have to leave for the Holy Land, and the moment my back is turned the scheming and plotting will start. \n\nI have tried to reconcile with John and he seems to respect my precedence, but even in that reconciliation his distrust was visible. It’s only natural, he was about to succeed father. It will not be easy for me to win him over. Father’s loyalists are sure to take advantage."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.14.a:0 "I will leave Mother in charge of England."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.15.t:0 "The Great Crusading Army"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.15.d:0 "Having finally secured the throne, only one prospect remains for me, the Holy Land. Philip has also expressed interest in joining me. After a bit of talk, we decided that it is best to join forces.\n\n"I propose that all the necessary preparations, all the knights we summon and the taxes we collect shall to be brought down to Paris. And you shall join me there." Why does Philip think I would agree to that? He pauses a while, as if expecting me to be puzzled, then says, "It is a strategic move, my friend. Do you remember who led the Second Crusade? It was my father." \n\n"With my mother," I interject. "When she was his queen. How does that factor in to now?"\n\n"Because emotion factors in. The drama, the pageantry of it all. Yes, a simple threat to the faith is enough to evoke anger in many, I know, but it is a long and dangerous journey and some of them may not find it worth the effort. There are some we will have to shake up with empathy." He smiles darkly. "Or vengeance. My father’s expedition was a failure. He suffered great losses and Edessa is still lost. \n\n"Now the son takes over the work his father left incomplete, right where it was done the last time. The number of men who will enlist, the number of knights who will rally behind us will be unimaginable. We might also need to raise taxes to collect funds a bit faster." \n\n"How can you be certain?" \n\n"You will see."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.15.a:0 "His argument seems to carry weight."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.15.b:0 "We can do with what we have."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.16.t:0 "The Start"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.16.d:0 "We leave today for the Holy Land. As we leave the Royal Palace in Paris I am greeted an ocean of people hailing our names. As I try to contain my astonishment, Philippe starts addressing them: "My dear friends, it fills my heart with great joy, to find you all here. I still remember the day clear, as clear as what I see before me, when I first heard the news that Saladin stood at the gates of Jerusalem. And since that day, I have not been able to rest." \n\nI smile. Philippe is as silver tongued as ever. \n\n"The only thing that stopped me from leaving on this journey before was duty-- the duty to deliver justice to my friend's family upon his death, the duty to pay the debt of friendship, and the duty to ensure that life shall be fair to those who treasure the values of Christianity. \n\nBut now I leave to fulfill another duty-- the duty to ensure that the people who treasure these values are safe, be they a part of my domain or not. Today, King Richard and I stand before you, dressed as pilgrims, not as kings. And that is what we shall be until the Holy Land is returned to civilization." \n\nThe crowd cheers. With this speech, he has not only addressed the French people, but also the Church. There have been those critical of him for not helping enough with the Vatican’s expeditions in the past. But somehow, he has even presented his absence as a service to faith. While he holds the favor of his people, they will never be able to question him again."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.16.a:0 "I wish I could say the same about my people..."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.17.t:0 "Genoa"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.17.d:0 "Philippe ponders a map of Sicily. I can see it is somewhat out of date, and he has made revisions to it himself. "We have to divide our forces for now. That way we can move in seclusion. We have not fully recovered from our losses over the past years. This is all we have. But I am not so sure we must meet in Messina. I wanted to tell you this before, but--" \n\n"My dear sister has become a widow. King William passed last year." \n\nHe winces sympathetically. "I am afraid that is not the extent of our sorrow, dear friend. I sent a royal envoy to Sicily, to pay my condolences. I was delayed due to our preparations for this journey, I admit, but it led to a discovery. William’s cousin Tancred has taken his place." \n\n"What? But he has no claim! And what became of Joan? Is she safe?" \n\n"She was nowhere to be found. There are rumors, she might be his prisoner. Forgive me, but with our time devoted to God’s work, I never got the occasion to tell you." \n\nI saw red. Unbecoming words passed my lips. I took a drink to steady my nerves. "We must go to Messina, to rescue my sister." \n\n"Then so it shall be. If you wish to take sea route..."\n\nSuddenly, I am not so sure I can trust Philippe. What else has he concealed from me? "I will take the land route, like we planned before." \n\nHe shrugs. "So be it. I shall prepare to set sail.""
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.17.a:0 "My eyes narrow as he leaves me."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.18.t:0 "Rome"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.18.d:0 "A city like no other I have ever seen. My astonishment cannot be contained. Audierne used to tell me the city of Rome is as old as the continent itself. Father would tell me and my brothers, the legends of Caesar and Roman Legions. \n\nEverything we hold dear today started in this city. This was the seat the ancient Roman Empire that fell hundreds of years ago. The signs of their greatness are still visible in the sculptures and architecture around the city. The Pantheon, the Colosseum, these are hundreds of years old structures. It is impossible to even think how they managed to build them. And now I shall meet with his Holiness, the Pope, before journeying on to Messina. \n\nI have realized that Philippe was trying to manipulate me into getting furious, sailing ahead and attacking Tancred. Meanwhile Philippe would have the blessings of the Pope, and come to save the day when my army exhausted. He would have been an even greater hero, a true defender of the faith, and he wanted to step on my neck to do that."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.18.a:0 "I am not so certain France is my friend."


 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.19.t:0 "Messina"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.19.d:0 "Lord Tancred, \n\nYou have been keeping my men at bay well enough, but I grow tired of these games. \nI know what you have done with Joan. You know full-well I have taken the duty of the defender of the faith. I merely need to say the word, and every duchy on the continent will turn against you. The German monarch will be eager enough to reclaim his wife’s domain. We shall see how long keep them at bay. But I shall give you a chance to resolve the situation. \n\nRelease Joan of England, along with her marital dowry of 20000 crowns, and I shall leave the shores of Sicily at once. Otherwise, I shall be forced to act on my threats. \n\nIn Christ, \n\nRichard, King of England"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.19.a:0 "Give me my sister!"

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.20.t:0 "Messina"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.20.d:0 "The city has fallen and Joan has been returned to me. That coward Tancred has fled, but my men will find him soon. An envoy arrived today with good news. After a long while, everything seems to be going right. "I see you are smiling," Philippe chuckles, in an uneasy manner, as he approaches. He wants to say something. \n\n"Because, I am relieved. But," I decide to press the point, "I feel you come to discuss something."\n\nHe looks at my banners for a moment, and then says, "We have taken the city, now we must prepare for our journey ahead." My men had not hung his banners, he seems visibly offended. I must fix this; I cannot afford another enemy. \n\n"We shall stay here a while, Philippe. The winter is upon us. The rations will be scarce. If we leave now, we will face new problems." I hesitate for a while, but then add, "My mother is coming here, and bringing my family." \n\nHis face falls, but he recovers. "Congratulations on that, dear friend. Forgive me for asking, but with your family arriving, I wonder..." he paused a while, "Do you wish to convert Messina into your base of operations?" \n\n"Our base Philippe, we conquered it together. Freeing the Holy Land will take more resources than we carry now." \n\nHe looks again to the banners. "As you say," he murmurs with the same unease. \n\nI miss... what once was between us, and may never be again. "The colors are a small error on my men’s part which I shall presently correct. Come, we must celebrate.""
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.20.a:0 "He does not smile back."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.21.t:0 "Messina"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.21.d:0 "That wretch Tancred has finally surrendered and signed peace treaty. Sicily shall be returned to him, but he shall allow the Crusaders to use it as a forward base. My nephew Arthur, shall marry his daughter when he comes of age; and Tancred shall pay me handsomely. \n\nPhilippe and his men sailed ahead to Acre soon after the treaty was signed. He has not completely forgotten the colors incident, it seems. \n\nI set sail today with my family."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.21.a:0 "Onward to Jerusalem!"

KoH_RichardTheLionheart.22.t:0 "The Island"
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.22.d:0 "I wake up with a physician over my head, "Where is my..." a cough presses my throat, "chamberlain?" \n\n"I am here, Your Majesty, but you must take care, the fever has not yet broken."\n\n"Were they--" I struggle with the cough again, "Were they found?" He hangs his head in shame.\n\nTen days ago, a storm hit my fleet, while we were at the sea, rising out of nowhere. We were struggling hard to keep on the path. Before we knew it, the waves started swallowing my ships whole one at a time, like monsters in the old legends. I could do nothing but watch like a helpless child. \n\nIn the chaos I lost track of the ship my family was aboard. After hours of struggling in the storm, we saw a coastline. As we dropped anchor, I prayed hard to the Lord to guide them to safety as well. Suddenly, I felt my vision starting to blur, my head burning like fire. \n\nI remember nothing after that.\n\n"Not yet, Your Majesty," says the chamberlain, "But there is some news." \n\n"What is-- What is it?"\n\n"We found one of our men from the ship that carried the Royal Family. He told me they had successfully made land a few miles from here, but they were ambushed and the Royal Family was taken. He was weak from his wounds, passed away soon after."\n\nAmbushed! By whom? I croak out, "He has done me a great service. His family will receive payment for his bravery. Now," I said, "Find me someone who knows this island.""
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.22.a:0 "From one hell to the next."

KoH_RichardTheLionheart.23.t:0 "The Wreckage on Cyprus"
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.23.d:0 "I see five of my ships crashed as I walk the beach waiting for the envoy to return. Many more were not even found. They must have landed the beach helplessly, unprepared, and were ambushed and killed. The beach is shrouded in the corpses of my men. \n\nOnly my family’s ship floats the shallows intact. They must have held the attackers for a while. There are signs of a skirmish. I can see some dead men wearing other colors as well. An abscure member of the Komnenos family, little better than a pirate and base his in morals, governs Cyprus. I care not how this came to be. I only care for retrieving my captured family. \n\n"Your Majesty, the envoy," said the chamberlain.\n\n"Let him approach." I decide. "What says Isaakos?"\n\nThe envoy is grimfaced. "Your majesty, I have one letter-- our proposal, torn to shreds. He refused to release the Royal Family."\n\nI grit my teeth. "Then, there will be no more talk.""
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.23.a:0 "Let the pirate burn for this."

KoH_RichardTheLionheart.24.t:0 "Limassol, Cyprus"
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.24.d:0 "Limassol hardly posed a challenge. Half the members of Komnenos’s court changed sides, petrified by my military history as well as my affiliations with the Pope. They quickly exposed the weaknesses in the city's defenses in exchange for immunity. And the city fell down like a house of cards. \n\n"Your Majesty," says the chamberlain, "Robert of Turnham approaches."\n\nI wave him toward me. "What brings you here, Robert?"\n\n"Your Majesty, I was scouting outside the city when I was approached by a couple of sheepherders. They say that Komnenos is hiding in their village." \n\n"Why help him, only to betray him immediately?"\n\n"Perhaps, they believe they weren’t well compensated." \n\n"Or they were, so well even, that they agreed to lure me into a trap." Robert looks puzzled, he hadn’t thought from that perspective. "Forgive me, but a king must think of all the paths."\n\n"A wise decision, Your Majesty. I never considered an ambush."\n\n"Are the sheepherders still with you? Surround their village, and send these very men back with a proposal. If Komnenos surrenders and returns my family safely, I shall let him go.""
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.24.a:0 "As though I would let this man walk free..."

KoH_RichardTheLionheart.25.t:0 "An Exiled King in Cyprus"
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.25.d:0 "Guy of Lusignan arrives to meet me. Since the day he was crowned the king of Jerusalem, he has been fighting Saladin, losing all his lands, within two years of being crowned.  This man is an idiot. \n\nBut his failures do not leave him useless to me, rather useful. I can use him to learn about how Saladin operates. I shall welcome him as a friend. \n\n"Hail Richard the Lion, king of England!"\n\n"Welcome! Eat, drink and feel safe, for you are among friends."\n\n"Thank you, my friend. I shall forever remember this hospitality."\n\n"You sail from Acre, I’m told. How is Philipe?"\n\n"His Majesty is the reason I decided to leave Acre to meet with you, Your Majesty." Guy paused to look around. I waved every to leave, so he may speak freely. He continued, "Conrad of Montferrat has rivaled my claim to the throne of Jerusalem for some time now. I did not see much hope for either of us, but as the crusading army grows in strength, Jerusalem may be freed from the grasp of Saladin one day."\n\n"You need me to support your claim to throne. I see."\n\n"Yes but," he pauses, "the situation is such that King Philippe has chosen to support Conrad."\n\n"And he is not wrong to do that. You claimed the throne through your wife’s inheritance and so does Conrad, but your wife, as we know, has already passed away."\n\nDisappointed with this pronouncement, Guy grows quiet for a while. "He also seems critical of your conquest of Cyprus." With nothing left to say and desperation in eyes, he makes one last attempt, "If nothing else would move you, know that I hail from Lusignan; and with no one else to turn to, you are my last hope, my liege." \n\nHis family in France are vassals of Aquitaine, long loyal to my Mother's family. If he will swear loyalty to me, Jerusalem might become the first piece of my own empire. To move against Conrad is to stand against Philippe. With many of our disagreements still unresolved, if I support Guy, there might be no going back."
KoH_RichardTheLionheart.25.a:0 "Putting Guy on the throne is a risk worth taking."

KoH_RichardTheLionheart.26.d:0 "Isaac hiding in the village was a ruse to lure me. And despite the village being surrounded, somehow, he still escaped. He eludes me for now. \n\nA guard spotted my family at the city gate in the middle of night. I assume, with no means to seize back the control over the island, Isaac decided to flee, freeing my family as a backhand truce-call. \n\nWith no other prospect, Cyprus shall secede to my control now, as a territory of England."
