They claim their origin is Lyon”.\n\nAt the forefront is one [peter.GetTitledFirstName], and unbeknownst to the bailiff, word from Archbishop [archbishop.GetTitledFirstName] had advanced at a faster pace, with the intent to inform myself of an approaching band of so-called ‘heretics’, barred and exiled from Lyon. The Archbishop gives a warning, expressing his disgust of them, and expresses his belief that I shall make the correct decision on the matter.\n\nIt takes less than an afternoon for Pèire to begin preaching in the town square of Feurs. Donning fine robes, you approach the disheveled man of cloth by horseback, and you reciprocate his gaze. An hour passes, as he pays little attention to his senses, speaking plainly in Franco-Provençal, and a small crowd begins to form. It is clearly heresy, as defined by the church, and Vaudès continues to speak of the corruption of the church by worldly goods and temptations. It is then you dismiss yourself, returning to your residence. “Dear the Most Reverend and Holy Archbishop of Lyon, I am corresponding in response to your previous letter to tell you I have made the decision to…"

The grandiose Abbey of Saint Martin overlooks the scene of the stern Archbishop’s grievances, likely chosen for the sole purpose of intimidation, as remarked by my chamberlain. \n\n“I need not your confirmation on the matter, however I believe you should be aware that the Bishop of Feurs recently had parts of his own home desecrated by these charlatan-followers you grant asylum. The Bishop has seen attendance of his mass shrink substantially, and tells me that he believes the majority of your domain has begun to protest against the supposed unjust wealth of the church. This is dangerous, Guigues; these men worship a false idol. And what is your response to this? What shall you do? Idle like your so-called martial ancestors did when called to the Holy Lands?” It is quite clear the Archbishop seems satisfied with himself, smirking caddishly. “The Pope could get involved in my request, you are aware?”"

It was at this moment that Guigues considered his position converting to a heretical interpretation of the word of god, and knew the journey ahead would be difficult. \n\nIt was one thing for a group of citizens to interpret the scripture in a non-conforming manner, but this moment would certainly mean the beginning of a new schism in the church, albeit minor. \n\nFor a nobleman carries a certain power the peasantry could not sustain, Vaudès had hope his ideals would be treated with a degree of newfound merit; whether that be through subtle acknowledgment… or warfare."

Protesting the wealth of the church among other things, [pope.GetTitledFirstName] has called for action against Forez."
