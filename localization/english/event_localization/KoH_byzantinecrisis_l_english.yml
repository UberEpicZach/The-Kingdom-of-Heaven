 KoH_byzantinecrisis.1.t: "The Governor of Isaura"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.1.d: "My liege! I bring dire news!" calls one of my couriers as he pushes quickly through the crowd of people. \n\n"Isaakios Komnenos, the old Governor of Isaura, has finally paid his ransom and was last seen with a small army sailing for Cyprus! \n\nI must report sir, that it was you who refused to pay off his ransom, after his capture in Cilicia -- so I fear his loyalties."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.1.a: "Our cousin rules Cyprus, we will not worry"
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.2.t: "Another Day, Another Woman"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.2.d: ""It... is fantastic to be emperor!" I chuckle to myself after bedding another lord’s wife-- \nIt is my right after all. But my closest advisor disagrees with my thoughts: "Basileus Rhomaiôn, this is not the first, nor the last time your noblemen will catch you with their wives. You are not exactly discreet. You keep sending them antlers." \n\nHe mentions that if these nobles simply banded together in anger, Constantinople would fall within a days end. \n\nMy brilliant mind is inspired -- if the aristocracy "simply" did not exist - I would never face such a day.""
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.2.a: "For I know the most "full-flavored" wines and the most adequate of ropes..."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.2.b: "Perhaps we blackmail the nobles instead?"

 KoH_byzantinecrisis.3.t: "Great Power"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.3.d: "It is my responsibility to put these nobles in their place. So what if I have made them cuckolds? That is a matter between their lovely wives and me. No reason for them to become so angry! \n\nRemoving the irritating nobles from power feels SO relieving. I finally have the abilities which my ancestors of Rome wielded, the same powers held by the likes of Augustus or Kōnstantînos...  \n\n"YOUR MAJESTY!" a voice screams, interrupting my thoughts.\n"The Normans have landed!""
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.3.a: "Raise the armies of Rome! For the glory!"
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.4.t: "Bulgarian Taxes"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.4.d: ""By order of the House of Asen and the people of Bulgaria, we demand you lower the taxes placed ipon us! \n\nNo longer will we fill the pockets of the empire when the empire does nothing for us!" \n\nAnother peasant leader, thinking he has any say. The rabble have gotten a taste of blood off my predecessor. "We'll be able to put this down quickly" says my trusted uncle."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.4.a: "I am the Emperor!"
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.50.t: "You Should Not See This"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.50.d: "If this event is visable, please leave a bug report on the Kingdom of Heaven discord."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.50.a: "Uh Oh, a Bug?"

 KoH_byzantinecrisis.6.t: "The Siege of Thessalonika"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.6.d: "The great city of Thessalonika laid under surpise siege, both from the sea and from the land numbering thousands; we have no men around to relieve her. \n\nMy governor of the city was mere useless. It seems as though he has opened her to be plundered."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.6.a: "Let it fall; it wasn't loyal from the start."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.6.b: "Let us execute the governor who put us in this position!"
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.7.t: "It begins with an 'I'"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.7.d: "I hear word that an icon of my patron saint, Paul, has been seen to weep. \nFor the first time in my life, I am struck with doubt. The oracle comes at my call. Blinded twenty years past for witchcraft, Seth Skleros still has uncanny sight. \nWith a bowl of water, he summons a demon to tell me of the fate of my empire. \nMy successor’s name, he says, will begin with iota, and rise to replace me during a holy festival in September."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.7.a: "I should announce my son Ioannes as my heir."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.7.b: "Isaakios Komnenos is conspiring against me."


 KoH_byzantinecrisis.8.t: "Traitors in the Mist"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.8.d: "I was having an excellent time with the wife of the marshall. We were mid-dinner when a courier whispered terrible news. Thessalonika has been sacked... looted, the population raped and enslaved... Isaakios Komnenos has taken Cyprus by force, proclaiming himself Emperor of Cyprus.\n\nI convene my council to discuss a route forward, only to get hard stares and angry voices telling me that everything is my fault. They have chosen a new leader.\n\nDo they really think they can leave the city? \nSilly."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.8.a: "Arrest the traitors!"
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.9.t: "A fateful duel"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.9.d: "My most loyal friend, Stephanos Hagiochristophorites, ventured out personally with his retinue to arrest an aristocrat called Isaakios Angelos, who was both a popular man and known rebel. Perhaps Stephanos noticed something was off-- the oddly silent streets of Constantinople, the unusually chilly day, with the trees turning brown with autumn... It was meant to be an easy task. Some would say he knew it was his last.\n\nYoung Angelos, resolved to die fighting, came out mounted with weapon in hand. The sound of the hooves on the paved street echoed throughout the plaza. This was a soldier, a son of a general! Stephanos turned to flee and then from the corner of his eye -- the glint of a silvery sword as it struck him from behind. The duel was over before it had really begun.\n\nI return from my home outside Constantinople to learn that this upstart Isaakios Angelos has proclaimed himself emperor of the people."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.9.a: "I will not give up my crown!"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.9.b: "It would be best to get out of here!"
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.10.t: "A hasty exit"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.10.d: "There is a mob gathering in the streets. In a panic, we make for the harbor. I bustle my child-bride and my mistress onto a ship and set sail as soon as we can, although in the distance, it is clear a storm is brewing."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.10.a: "Sail, Sail."
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.11.t: "A Crash Into the Harbour"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.11.d: "Less then an hour out to sea, and the storm slams our ships vigorously until eventually tossing us out of the ship completely, knocking me unconscious...\n\nI awake, dragged through the harbour of Constantinople into the waiting hands of the riotous crowd.\nI see familiar faces surrounding me as they bind my hands, and thinking quickly, I begin to sing a popular lament, conjuring up tears of what I hope looks like remorse. To my delight, the crowd begins to sing along!"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.11.a: "It has worked before..."
 
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.12.t: "A Gruesome Fate"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.12.d: "They tie me in the agora beside my son. They kick at me, wrenching the beard from my face and the hair from my head. The beautiful women I’ve bedded come to me, not to offer comfort, but to punch me in the mouth! After so many blows, my mouth is shredded on broken teeth. But still, I hold a faint glimmer of hope that the frenzy will die down, until some cur fetches an axe. The rabble roar with approval when he cuts off my hand! I scream and scream until my throat seizes, and I can produce no more sound.\n\nThey turn on my son, plucking his eyes from his head as I have done to so many of my enemies. My good son, who refused to participate in my crimes, who would have been a worthy emperor, is beaten to death beside me. I cannot scream. I clutch my stump against my chest, woozy. They strip me of my clothes, hoist me up onto a mangy camel, and cheer my pitiful state. They throw stones and ox shit. The camel is led to my favorite place-- the theater. A prostitute comes forward with an earthen pot, acting as though she will cleanse me. She pours scalding water over my face\n\n"Lord have mercy," I cry out, "Why do you further bruise the broken reed?""
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.12.a: "Finally, the mercy of the sword..."

 KoH_byzantinecrisis.13.t: "An Empire in Tatters"
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.13.d: "The streets still run with the blood of the last emperor. He was a lusty fool and I am a soldier, chosen by the people. Still, I get the sense that the mob is fickle and their love will not keep if I do not settle some of their complaints. I shall marry the daughter of my strongest neighbor! My new ally will need a show of our glory, but there is that pesky invasion to deal with..."
 KoH_byzantinecrisis.13.a: "Fund a new army."
