 chivalry.1.t: "The Peasants of the Realm"
 chivalry.1.d: "Raised as a lord, I had all the comforts of a wealthy life. I knew abstractly that someone had to pay the price for that. Every season, the serfs of this land work to the bone, yet their only reward is that their lives are spared for another day. I have been taught that this is natural, since the powerful must rein the weak, but is that really how a ruler should be? Should my subjects work hard day and night only for a protection which might not even be provided?"
 chivalry.1.a: "I could do better."
 chivalry.1.b: "That is the nature of life."
 
 chivalry.2.t: "An Unexpected Duel"
 chivalry.2.d: "As I walk down the streets of my capital, I hear a voice. "You there!" a man yells, drawing his sword. \n\n"What do you want?" I respond quickly, hand on my hilt. \n\n"You are [ROOT.Char.GetNameNicknamed]. An exceptional warrior, so they say, and I am here to fight you for glory!" \n\nWe size each other up at a glance."
 chivalry.2.a: "If you wish for that duel, then prepare."
 chivalry.2.b: "I got no time to waste to people like you."
 
 chivalry.3.t: "The Duel"
 chivalry.3.d: "As we both draw our weapons, I realize a weakness in my opponent's defense. Before I have time to react though, [challenger.GetName] charges in, catching me off-guard. I find myself on the defensive, unable to deal any blows to my opponent. What shall I do?"
 chivalry.3.a: "I must counter-attack."
 
 chivalry.4.t: "Victory"
 chivalry.4.d: "The fight continues. Both of us exchange blow after blow, hoping to defeat one another. Suddenly, I see an opening. As I slash into it, [challenger.GetName] takes a step back and yells "I yield!" He draws a ragged breath. "It seems I have been bested by you.""
 chivalry.4.a: "Good duel, my new friend."
 chivalry.4.b: "I shall not take light this challenge."
 
 chivalry.5.t: "Defeat"
 chivalry.5.d: "The fighting continues on. As we exchange blows, I feel like I am losing more and more stamina, whilst my opponent remains unshaken. The duel has developed into a fight for my survival. The clash of steel, and the ferocity of [challenger.GetName] keeps me from going into the offensive. Suddenly, he slashes into me, knocking me on the ground."
 chivalry.5.a: "I yield!"
 
 chivalry.6.t: "A Day at Training"
 chivalry.6.d: "Hour after hour passes by, training with my squire on sword to sword combat. I defeat him again, but the instructor is angry with me, as always. "You should focus more on opportunities than raw strength." After the training session, those words come back to me. Is it time to change my fighting methods?"
 chivalry.6.a: "Skill and strength. I must preserve my stamina."
 chivalry.6.b: "Brute force. I must be feared on the battlefield."
 
 chivalry.7.t: "In the Midst of Chaos"
 chivalry.7.d: "As the battle rages on, chaos erupts. Fellow countrymen and companions fall one by one, sagging into the mire. As I defeat the enemy soldiers that engage me one by one, a knight yells to me an appraisal of the current situation: "The enemy is preparing for an attack!" \n\nI think to myself that this is an opportunity.
 chivalry.7.a: "This is where we stand, and where they die!"
 chivalry.7.b: "Charge! For glory!"
 
 chivalry.8.t: "In the Midst of Chaos"
 chivalry.8.d: "PLACEHOLDER"
 chivalry.8.a: "You piece of shit. You will die!"
 chivalry.8.b: "I cannot beat him."
 
 chivalry.9.t: "Mysterious Beast Troubling [town_scope.GetName]"
 chivalry.9.d: "The peasants of [town_scope.GetName] have been reporting attacks from a mysterious beast. It is claimed by many that this beast appears to be a 'dragon', though none have seen it clearly. Many soldiers and knights of the realm have been murmuring about me doing nothing against these attacks."
 chivalry.9.a: "Really? A dragon? Stop with these fairy tales."
 chivalry.9.b: "Fearsome dragon, thou doth not scare me."
 chivalry.9.c: "Give me my sword and shield. I ride to the legend."
 chivalry.9.dd: "A dragon? Perhaps I could make a new ally."
 start_dragon_hunting: "The beast shall die before me"

 chivalry.10.t: "A Draconic Encounter"
 chivalry.10.d: "The cave the peasants gave directions to looked fanciful, jutting out of the earth in a most unnatural fashion. \nMy small party hesitated; the stories they were told as children were rubbish, of course, but it seemed all too real at this point in time. \n\nReality itself was shattered then, when a monumental beast emerged from the cave! With rapid fury, my standard bearer was eaten in a single, forceful motion, on behalf of the creature."
 chivalry.10.a: "Signal the men to attack."
 chivalry.10.b: "Get out! Get out of here!"

 chivalry.15.t: "Songs shall be Sung!"
 chivalry.15.d: "With half of my party perishing, certain doom was felt by all during the period of intense violence that dominated the field. \nAlas, the scaled behemoth fell upon the ground with a quaking thump, and saw before him his conquerors. \n\nWhile some may not believe such a feat, my party can attest the truth; my might has won against a mythical beast of legend! \nSurely, my name will be written among those of great merit."
 chivalry.15.a: "Hurrah!"

 chivalry.16.t: "Overwhelmed"
 chivalry.16.d: "It is not long before I find myself overwhelmed by the dragon, with my entire party finding themselves among his latest meal. I have tried my hardest to avoid death, but god knows what will happen to me now."
 chivalry.16.a: "Brace myself for Impact..."

 chivalry.17.t: "He Speaks"
 chivalry.17.d: "Avoiding notice of my guardians, I sneak out at night, alone, to the cave of the mythical creature. \n\nThey say my ramblings of children's stories are nonsense, but it is with my eyes, and not my mind, that I see it before me. \n\n"You have come not to wound me, as that would be foolish to attempt alone" the dragon whispers. "Some would call you insane, but you are clever not to challenge me. If you are to offer me a boon, I could perhaps grant thou a gift.""
 chivalry.17.a: "You may eat whom you wish, O Dragon!"
 chivalry.17.b: "Take my wealth, I do not need it!"
 chivalry.17.c: "I do not give boons to cave-dwellers."

 chivalry.18.t: "Mysterious Power"
 chivalry.18.d: "I awake the next morning with a vague memory of my previous encounter. It is one of my servants that notices it first. "Oh dear! Are you alright, my liege?""
 chivalry.18.a: "The Dragon kept his end of the bargain."

 chivalry.11.t: "An Adulterer Knight"
 chivalry.11.d: "PLACEHOLDER"
 chivalry.11.a: "He is one of my knights, his intentions must have been for a good reason."
 chivalry.11.b: "He shall be exiled from my realm."
