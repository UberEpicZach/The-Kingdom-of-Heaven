 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.1.t: "Reflections on My Life"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.1.d: "It has been around 20 years since my official coronation as the Amir al-Mu'minin of the al-Muwahhidun empire, and all praises be to Allah for all the life I've went through. My office as the second Almohad caliph has been a very busy post to hold. Challengers, conquests, Jihad, revolts, conspiracies to the throne, border raids, plagues - it seemed as if I have been given the opportunity to complete much of the fitna (trial) written by Allah.\n\nDespite all that, I still have the blessing of time to quench my scholarly pursuits of knowledge. Although, tafakkur (self-relection) is a noble subject within the Qur'an and Sunnah, so I might as well do that for the moment."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.1.a: "Let's see if I can recall some events..."

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.2.t: "War against Ibn Mardanish - the Wolf King"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.2.d: "Muhammad ibn Mardanish, a thorn to my conquests of Andalusia. Had it not been for him, I would have saved more troops for the realm and increased better control of Andalusia under my iron fist. Nonetheless, I managed to make his kingdom submit as vassals and out of my mercy - perhaps the mercy of Allah - I left his family alive and still have control on his lands.\n\nFrom the stories about him from the locals, it appears he was called as the Rex Lupus, due to his insane behaviours at the end of his life? Perhaps he became too paranoid of our military advances in Andalusia - nay - it is the curse for a Muslim king making cursed alliance with the kuffar (disbelievers) just to keep his dominion independant, instead of submitting to me peacefully. On this, I pray to Allah that his dynasty won't cause any further ruckus to my family and the future Almohad caliphs, this is for the best of the Muslims of Andalusia and the Maghreb."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.2.a: "Amin. Now what else I can think of..."

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.3.t: "Trouble on the West"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.3.d: "At the south of Marrakesh, our blessed capital, some Berber tribes - among them the Sanhaja - have the audacity to launch a revolt against me. The biggest obstacle of all, was they hid around the Atlas mountains. Praises be to Allah, it was halted in a relatively short amount of time since my troops were dispatched immediately after the news reached to me.\n\nThese revolts are indeed something to be careful of, they reminded me of my father's rise by erecting this empire through a revolt against the al-Murabitun."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.3.a: "Since I mentioned about the West, something reminds me of the East..."

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.4.t: "Trouble on the East"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.4.d: "Ah yes, the terrible Qaraqush al-Taqawi! That fool has the guts to launch large-scale raids on the eastern border of the Almohad empire, causing my governor in Ifriqiya to suffer massive casualties and destruction in his realm. Lucklily enough, he managed to return back to his base before my arrival with my troops at Ifriqiya.\n\nWe did our best to restore Ifriqiya and from the intel we have heard, the Bedouin tribes such as Banu Sulaym collaborated with that slave-soldier, thus explaining his strong manpower. Now that I think of it, Salahuddin seems to have the boldness to expand his western wing, on my realm!"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.4.a: "The mere mention of that Mamluk boils my blood!"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.5.t: "The Fitna of Plague"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.5.d: "The most tragic of all, a plague was struck on my realm! It began in Cordoba, but later spread until Marrakesh, out of all cities. By the Will of Allah, my family and I were able to escape its atrocities, although the locals, as well as some of my loyal shaykhs and governors, were affected by this fitna. Many have become victims to the plague, and because of that most of the economic sectors of the empire were halted. Movement was restricted on the advise of scholars. And during this period, the kuffar initiated raids at the borders of Andalusia, as if they're provoking my limits in movement during the pandemic.\n\nBy the Grace of Allah, this fitna was finally lifted from us! Most of my time recently was devoted to solve this issue. Our prayers, efforts and time as the thinktankers and servants of Allah were finally accepted. With reconcetrated efforts, the Almohad empire has grown significantly and our outputs have been inclining!"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.5.a: "Alhamdulillah for the health and growth of my realm!"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.6.t: "Jihad: Restart"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.6.d: "Ah, I think I have been standing here for too long pondering! Analyzing back all those events, I believe the time has come for me to return to Andalusia, and launch a Jihad, minor or major. My realm, by the Help and Will of Allah, is in peace and stability afterall. My advisers ensured me that nothing will broke out in the Maghreb, and this is the perfect moment to return to Andalusia.\n\nI trust their judgement, and I can feel Andalusia needs my aid in progressing the long-paused Jihad."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.6.a: "The question is, who and where should face our retribution?"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.7.t: "Crossing the Straits"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.7.d: "It is time to return to al-Andalus. I took the chance to visit my son, heir and vizier, Abu Yusuf Ya'qub, at Tangier since it was on the same route to Sabta. He was pretty delighted to see me, welcomed me with joy to his court, and even accompanied me until we reach the docks. Indeed, I have raised this son well enough, befitting for the next Amir al-Mu'minin. He really reminds me of Prophet Sulayman to Prophet Dawud. May Allah bestow forgiveness and prosperity to this child, as well as all child of mine.\n\nWhile the boats are filled with our supplies, I thought long of who shall be our target, and I have yet to meet my answer. Perhaps I will have my answer during our trip to Seville, in order to raise the Andalusian troops. This would also be the best time for me to do a visit to the realm of my son, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, the governor of Seville.\n\nMy son Ya'qub then gives me his farewell Salam before my departure."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.7.a: "Wa'alaykum-al-salam my son. Bismillah, now, we set sail!"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.8.t: "Pearl of Andalusia, Hims al-Andalus" 
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.8.d: "Having arrived at Seville, and greeted warmly by the Jama'ah (congregation) of my son, I was immediately brought to their court to discuss the war strategy. Indeed, I have found my answer, and that is Lisbon at the Kingdom of Portugal. For so long, the Portuguese have harassed and launched raids on the western borders of Andalusia. My son and his Jama'ah agreed to my idea, and so we planned all the setup needed to be raised in few days.\n\nHaving a littile leisure time, I set a small tour around the city. I then arrived at the site of my project for a great mosque for Seville. The mosque part is mostly complete and the salah (act of worship) can be done there. However, with the absence of a minaret, it cannot fulfill Jumu'ah (Friday) salah, therefore nullifying its full status as a Masjid. The funds had been diversified for other uses within the realm, and I truly hope for more investments for this mosque. On the final day of my stay at my personal palace, I have assembled the army to march towards Lisbon!"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.8.a: "Al-Jihad-u-fi-sabil-illah!"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.9.t: "Siege of Santarém"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.9.d: "With our successful march, we end up on Santarém, as a way to reach Lisbon. We have set up tents on the outskirts of Santarém. This time with the inclusion of siege engines in our midst, a siege to the walls of Santarém won't be that difficult!"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.9.a: "(Or so he thought...)"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.91.t: "The Almohad Attack on Portugal!"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.91.d: "A Messenger arrives to meet you in extreme haste! On the words of the outer villages of our realm, ones close to our border with the Almohads, the exclaim about massive force meant for Lisbon - the centerpiece of the old King of Portugal. \n\n My advisors tell me that joining on the side of the Portuguese and sending a relief force would be for the best of the faith; although the Almohads stand in greater numbers and could be a challenge."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.91.a: "Call the Banners." 
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.91.b: "We shall watch from here." 

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.10.t: "Unwelcomed News"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.10.d: ""Ya Amir al-Mu'minin!" shouted a servant. "We have received news that the King of Leon will be joining to relieve this town!" "What?!" I shouted with full of shock. "It was said that he brought fifteen thousand men and will be reaching here in a few days", again said the servant nervously. I was full in shock as this is unprecedented that Portugal and Leon have an alliance. "You sure this news is legitimate?", I said. "Yes!" he replied, "We got this piece of information from the locals here as well as on the Christian side". Shambles! Now that we are so exposed due to the siege, the only viable option is to move the tents across the river and regroup. "What are you doing men?! Obey my orders!""
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.10.a: "(Panic and confusion ensues)"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.11.t: "Surrounded"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.11.d: "Darn it! The Portuguese were afterall waiting for the right moment to attack us with thousands men when we are in our fears. With my troops being on the other side of the river, it is impossible to order my troops to return back. It was all trap! My men are blinded with their confusion and panic, to the audacity of leaving me mostly unguard in a red tent! Abhorrently outrageous!\n\nThe kuffar now daringly started to face me, the Almohad caliph and my personal guards! The loathsome crown prince of the Portuguese even has the venture to lead his troops against us the Monothiests! What now? Six Portuguese peasants daringly pose in a duel stance against me?"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.11.a: "Looks like I have to take care of this myself! Allahuakbar!"

 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.12.t: "Mawt (Death) the Unescapable Destiny"
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.12.d: "Killing thoses six disbelievers are not that bad. But as time goes, we are totally outnumbered. Now a man with a spear tries to kill me!\n\n(Being surrounded at all sides, the Portuguese spearman gained the upper hand and delivers the fatal strike...)\n\nThis... pain. A... spear... has... stabbed... in me. Is this... the end of me? The end... of... my rule? Perhaps... there was reason... why Allah made me... to ponder back my... previous life events. From all of its... sweet and bitter. It is... life. And it... has its end.\n\nI feel betrayed, but it was my judgement that led my men to abandon me. At long last, noble or not, we all leave this dunya (world) to return to the Most High, as just... humans... creation... nothing more. Ya Allah, forgive me of my sins and faults, make us among your martyrs! With my last bits of life, I slowly uttered..."
 tib_abu_yaqub_yusuf_death.12.a: "...I bear witness there's no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger..."
