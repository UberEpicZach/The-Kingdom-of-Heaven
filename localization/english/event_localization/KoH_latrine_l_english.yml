  KoH_erfurt_affair.1.desc:0 "That fiend [SCOPE.sC('feuding_bishop').GetCharacterViewName]! I am almost certain he actively instructs his little entourage of bishops to harass me! They decry me as an 'impious feuder', but it is they who have begun this feud!"
  KoH_erfurt_affair.1.a:0 "Enough! Hand me some loose parchment."
  KoH_erfurt_affair.1.b:0 "There is little I can do..."

  KoH_erfurt_affair.2.desc:0 ""...and I would be most elated to meet at the arranged date, in the presence of [SCOPE.sC('kingheinrich').GetCharacterViewName]. Signed, [feuding_bishop.GetFirstName], the Archbishop of [SCOPE.sTitle('mainz_county').GetNameNoTier]." \n\nI dismiss my courier and waste no time making the arrangements needed. Letters are sent out to nobles across the realm, and transport is organized for my household to arrive in Erfurt in a fortnight."

They seek to remedy the fight at Erfurt this July. I have been invited to be a witness to this diet."

  KoH_erfurt_affair.4.desc:0 " A jovial mood is present in the hall of the church, as laborers rush about, preparing the best meals that can be offered at a feast. [feuding_bishop.GetFullName] and [bossman.GetFullName] mingled, the former adversaries exchanging words of advice, praise and agreement. Perhaps a feud could be remedied after all!

  KoH_erfurt_affair.50.desc:0 "Perhaps our tongues are more charming than our pens. Or perhaps this drink is very good...  Either way, what once seemed an insurmountable divide between [feuding_bishop.GetFirstName] and myself now resembles a petty disagreement, and I am inclined to set my temper aside. \n\nWe have vowed end hostilities and have negotiated new terms for [SCOPE.sTitle('thuringia_county').GetNameNoTier]. \n\nThe Diet ends earlier than planned."

Both parties vowed to end all hostilities. \n\nA curious new friendship has developed; it seems they had more in common than they thought.\n\nThe Diet ends earlier than planned."

There are dozens of people packed into pews in the loft above the sanctuary, pressed against each other in the stifling summer heat. \n\nA backhanded gibe here, a sneer there, and negotiations between [feuding_bishop.GetFirstName] and myself have ground to a halt. [SCOPE.sC('kingheinrich').GetCharacterViewName] paces restlessly. \n\nThe clerics have prepared hours of canon law to back the bishop's claim. Beyond their droning, smaller arguments ripple through the crowd.\n\nI hear the king summon the archbishop into one of the antechambers."

I grapple for the nearest pillar as the stone pews tip and slide through the growing hole in the splintering floor, taking some of the most illustrious nobles of the empire along with them. \n\nThe stone spears through the sanctuary below us, cracking the floor and exposing the latrine cesspit under the church. A stench fills the space as screaming people free-fall into the foul slosh."
