## SOZ CHAIN PART 1 By Seljuk Shah

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actone_branchone.1.desc:0 "I run into Ismat on my way to our sleeping quarters. There's not a servant in sight and I hesitate; there's been talk of her hiding the sword of her late husband from me. The blade of Zengi. \n\nIsmat glances at me, "What is it? You have that look again when you're deciding which horse to take on a hunt." She smiles, crossing her arms and waiting for me to say what is on my mind. I could demand the sword from her as her liege and rightful owner of such an important relic. \n\nBut then again, Ismat was never a woman to be intimidated so easily. She's always been an easy person to speak with and I would hate to ruin our companionship."
  soz_actone_branchone.1.a:0 "Are you comparing yourself to my horse?"
  soztip.1.tt:0 "Keep it light and friendly"
  soz_actone_branchone.1.b:0 "You will give me the sword of Zengi!"
  soztip.2.tt:0 "Intimidate; an unwise option"

  soz_actone_branchone.2.desc:0 "Ismat chuckles, "if only I should be so lucky." She steps closer and looks up at you. \n\n"Tell me truthfully, Yusuf. Why do you look at me so?""
  soz_actone_branchone.2.a:0 "I was thinking about Nur Al Din. What were your last moments with him like?"
  soz_actone_branchone.2.tta "Loyal follower"
  soz_actone_branchone.2.b:0 "Tell me about your father, Unur of Damascus."
  soz_actone_branchone.2.ttb "Lover"

  
  soz_actone_branchone.3.desc:0 "This is the last question I was expecting," Ismat says. She's hesitant now and crosses her arms again. "What can I really tell you? Didn't you grow up in his care?""
  soz_actone_branchone.3.a:0 "We had a falling out before he passed. You know this."
  soz_actone_branchone.3.b:0 "Tell me about your father, then. Unur of Damascus."

  soz_actone_branchone.4.desc:0 ""He was a zealout and you were more…practical? Isn't that why?" Ismat takes a deep breath before continuing. \n\n"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be harsh. But he dedicated his life to achieving his father's dream and uniting our Holy Land. And you… you were more than happy to break away from him. You want to know what our last moments were like? He was heartbroken. And I tried my best to make his last days easy.""
  soz_actone_branchone.4.a:0 "That's not true. Everything I did, I did for…"

  soz_actone_branchone.5.desc:0 "Ismat cuts you off, "Can we not do this in the middle of some corridor like some bickering kitchen-hands? We'll some other time, alright?""
  soz_actone_branchone.5.a:0 "Fine, good night."

  soz_actone_branchtwo.1.desc:0 ""We were close once. He would take me on his hunts despite my mother yelling at him every time we galloped away."\n\nIsmat cocks her head at me curiously, "I think he may have loved his horses even more than you!" She says with a laugh."
  soz_actone_branchtwo.1.a:0 "Hah! My father always spoke highly of his stubborness."

  soz_actone_branchtwo.2.desc:0 ""I've been surrounded by zealous men my entire life, Yusuf. And Unur of Damascus was the first of them. He sold his only daughter to secure a peace with Nur Al Din. \n\nI don't resent him, of course. He loved Damascus. And Nur Al Din was the light of my eyes.""
  soz_actone_branchtwo.2.a:0 "I hope I never have to choose between my people and my daughters."

  soz_actone_branchtwo.3.desc:0 ""You say that now, but you also know the price of power and what we must do to one day walk freely into Jerusalem once again.""
  soz_actone_branchtwo.3.a:0 "I know and we'll face it together. Shabakhair for now, love."


## SOZ CHAIN PART 2

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_acttwo_branchone.1.desc:0 "Ismat catches you as you return from the prayer room. "Sorry to interrupt, Yusuf. But my cousin's madrasa in Damascus is in dire need of funds. It's a hadith school for women and it's dangerously in debt to the landlord."
  soz_acttwo_branchone.1.a:0 "Of course, my love. Tell Isfahani to prepare a ledger for it."

  soz_acttwo_branchone.2.desc:0 "Thank you for your generosity, Yusuf."
  soz_acttwo_branchone.2.a:0 "Of course, my love. It's what Nur Al Din would've wanted."
  soz_acttwo_branchone.2.b:0 "It is not my generosity. Our Ummah needs this and more."
  soz_acttwo_branchone.2.tt:0 "True believer"

## SOZ CHAIN PART 3

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actthree_branchone.1.desc:0 "After morning talks with the council, it is always a wonderful moment to walk with Ismat through her garden in the afternoons before heading to prayer. Today she is waiting for me with some green tea and we drink quietly in each other's company. We get up to take our usual walk and she still hasn't said much. \n\nAs we pass her favorite jasmine tree, she stops to pluck a few flowers and make a bracelet out of them. "I've been wondering for a while," she finally says, "About how you would have treated Nur Al Din if he hadn't passed away so suddenly. Would you truly have betrayed him and declared yourself the sultan?""
  soz_actthree_branchone.1.a:0 "For the sake of uniting the Ummah under the best leadership, I would have."
  soz_actthree_branchone.1.tta:0 "True believer"
  soz_actthree_branchone.1.b:0 "I would never put you in harm's way, my love."
  soz_actthree_branchone.1.ttb:0 "Lover"
  soz_actthree_branchone.1.c:0 "Never! Nur Al Din was better suited to lead the Ummah."

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actthree_branchone.2.desc:0 "Ismat's eyes tear up but she quickly rubs her eyes and is back to her composed self. "Please follow me, my lord."
  soz_actthree_branchone.2.a:0 "Where to?"


  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actthree_branchone.3.desc:0 "Ismat takes me to a jasmine tree and stares at it a long while in silence before taking a deep breath and turning back to me. "Then you are a true Ghazi and the rightful heir of Zengi's legacy." \n\nShe reaches out in the thick vines riding up the jasmine tree and pulls out a blade of pure damascene steel, bearing the two headed eagle of Zengi on the pommel. She hands me the sword and bows formally, before walking away without a word and leaving me speechless."
  soz_actthree_branchone.3.a:0 "You are the Blessed Ghazi"
  soz_actthree_branchone.3.tta:0 "True believer"

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actthree_branchtwo.1.desc:0 "Ismat smiles lovingly and embraces you, not a care for anyone watching. "I thought you were only speaking to me so that you could have Zengi's sword that everyone's been gossiping about," she says, stepping back and composing herself. "I suppose it's nice to finally have a husband who puts me above his followers. I love you, Yusuf."
  soz_actthree_branchtwo.1.a:0 "I love you, too."
  soz_actthree_branchtwo.1.tta:0 "Lover"

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actthree_branchthree.1.desc:0 "Ismat's eyes light up and she smiles proudly. "It takes an honorable man to admit there are those better than him in station. You are a loyal servant, my husband. Even in your master's death."
  soz_actthree_branchthree.1.a:0 "I will always support the true Ghazi, whoever he may be."
  soz_actthree_branchthree.1.tta:0 "Yes, you just got cucked by a dead man."
