## SOZ CHAIN PART 1 By Seljuk Shah

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actone_branchone.1.desc:0 "I run into Ismat on my way to our sleeping quarters. There's not a servant in sight and I hesitate; there's been talk of her hiding the sword of her late husband from me. The blade of Zengi. \n\nIsmat glances at me, "What is it? You have that look again when you're deciding which horse to take on a hunt." She smiles, crossing her arms and waiting for me to say what is on my mind. I could demand the sword from her as her liege and rightful owner of such an important relic. \n\nBut then again, Ismat was never a woman to be intimidated so easily. She's always been an easy person to speak with and I would hate to ruin our companionship."
  soz_actone_branchone.1.a:0 "Are you comparing yourself to my horse?"
  soztip.1.tt:0 "Keep it light and friendly"
  soz_actone_branchone.1.b:0 "You will give me the sword of Zengi!"
  soztip.2.tt:0 "Intimidate; an unwise option"

  soz_actone_branchone.2.desc:0 "Ismat chuckles, "if only I should be so lucky." She steps closer and looks up at you. \n\n"Tell me truthfully, Yusuf. Why do you look at me so?""
  soz_actone_branchone.2.a:0 "I was thinking about Nur Al Din. What were your last moments with him like?"
  soz_actone_branchone.2.b:0 "Tell me about your father, Unur of Damascus."
  
  soz_actone_branchone.3.desc:0 "This is the last question I was expecting," Ismat says. She's hesitant now and crosses her arms again. "What can I really tell you? Didn't you grow up in his care?""
  soz_actone_branchone.3.a:0 "We had a falling out before he passed. You know this."
  soz_actone_branchone.3.b:0 "Tell me about your father, then. Unur of Damascus."

  soz_actone_branchone.4.desc:0 ""He was a zealout and you were more…practical? Isn't that why?" Ismat takes a deep breath before continuing. \n\n"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be harsh. But he dedicated his life to achieving his father's dream and uniting our Holy Land. And you… you were more than happy to break away from him. You want to know what our last moments were like? He was heartbroken. And I tried my best to make his last days easy.""
  soz_actone_branchone.4.a:0 "That's not true. Everything I did, I did for…"

  soz_actone_branchone.5.desc:0 "Ismat cuts you off, "Can we not do this in the middle of some corridor like some bickering kitchen-hands? We'll some other time, alright?""
  soz_actone_branchone.5.a:0 "Fine, good night."

  soz_actone_branchtwo.1.desc:0 ""We were close once. He would take me on his hunts despite my mother yelling at him every time we galloped away."\n\nIsmat cocks her head at me curiously, "I think he may have loved his horses even more than you!" She says with a laugh."
  soz_actone_branchtwo.1.a:0 "Hah! My father always spoke highly of his stubborness."

  soz_actone_branchtwo.2.desc:0 "I've been surrounded by zealous men my entire life, Yusuf. And Unur of Damascus was the first of them. He sold his only daughter to secure a peace with Nur Al Din. I don't resent him, of course. He loved Damascus. And Nur Al Din was the light of my eyes.""
  soz_actone_branchtwo.2.a:0 "I hope I never have to choose between my people and my daughters."

  soz_actone_branchtwo.3.desc:0 ""You say that now, but you also know the price of power and what we must do to one day walk freely into Jerusalem once again.""
  soz_actone_branchtwo.3.a:0 "I know and we'll face it together. Shabakhair for now, love."
