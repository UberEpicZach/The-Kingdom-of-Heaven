 KoH_saladin.1.d1: "It seems [Baldwin.GetTitledFirstName] of Jerusalem does possess some sense, and decided to hand over the barbarous Reynaud of Chatillon to receive punishment for his crimes.

But for the moment, what to do with the pesky Reynaud…"

Every pious soul in Christendom must mark and mourn this dark and fateful day."
 KoH_saladin.120.a: "We have sinned greatly for God to have forsaken us thus."

 KoH_saladin.121.t: "Cupiens vitare charybdim"
 KoH_saladin.121.d: "Jerusalem has fallen, the worst nightmare one could ever imagine. \n\nFor the first time in close to a hundred years, would the city be ruled from anyone other than the rightful faith, for even with god's prayers, for even the best knights in the realm, the best possible effort one could put forward, \n\nWe have lost, \n\nWe have lost Temple Mount, the great fortresses of Kerak and Toron, and even the Birthplace of Christ - Bethlehem, for what else is there now to do? \n\nBut to pray a final time, \nTo pray a miracle, \nTo pray for the safety of safety of the remaining christians in the remaining realm, \nFor it is us, \nAnd only us who are left to defend what it means to be Christian in the Levant."
