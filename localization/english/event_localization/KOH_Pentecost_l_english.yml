  KOH_Pentecost.1.t:0 "Preparations for the Pentecost"
  KOH_Pentecost.1.desc:0 "My victories have been widespread and numerous, and for myself to live on as one of the great kings of Europe, celebrations are in order. It was this, therefore, that spurred the announcement made last year to all in the central sphere of Europe; there was to be a grand diet in [SCOPE.sTitle('mainz_county').GetName] during this year’s Pentecost celebrations, and I am determined to display the chivalry and piety of my realm to the known world. My coffers are sadly finite, and the creation of a budget for this project is now set in motion."
  KOH_Pentecost.1.a:0 "Gather the bookkeepers!"
  KOH_Pentecost.1.a.tt:0 "The planning for the Pentecost begins"
  KOH_Pentecost.1.b:0 "I have better things to focus on!"

  KOH_Pentecost.cost_1:0 "This decision will weigh upon your finances"
  KOH_Pentecost.cost_2:0 "This decision will weigh heavily upon your finances"

  KOH_Pentecost.2.t:0 "Releasing the Summons"
  KOH_Pentecost.2.desc:0 "The volume of this gathering must be large, but not insurmountable; some of the more fiscally conservative advisers are dubious of our ability to accommodate so many guests."
  KOH_Pentecost.2.a:0 "Invite those of the Southern Circles."
  KOH_Pentecost.2.a.tt:0 "While unambitious, this would certainly lift the burden on our coffers."
  KOH_Pentecost.2.b:0 "All Germans shall attend!"
  KOH_Pentecost.2.b.tt:0 "A moderate approach, those from Saxony to Austria deserve recognition for their chivalry."
  KOH_Pentecost.2.c:0 "All subjects of the Empire shall attend!"
  KOH_Pentecost.2.c.tt:0 "While certainly expensive, this will lend legitimacy and unity to the Empire."

  KOH_Pentecost.3.t:0 "Activities"
  KOH_Pentecost.3.desc:0 "How we allocate funding is also dependent on the planned activities; while a feast is not only guaranteed, but expected, courtly activities may be the primary highlight of the diet."
  KOH_Pentecost.3.a:0 "A small tournament may suffice."
  KOH_Pentecost.3.b:0 "Don't forget Melee and Riding tournaments!"

  KOH_Pentecost.4.t:0 "An issue of Finances"
  KOH_Pentecost.4.desc:0 "A document is passed into my hands, and little time passes before I realize the contents of the letter as I begin the reading process; and it is not good! The extravagance of our planning has had some unintended consequences on our liquid assets, and my accountants warn that such liberal spending could have consequences. Two parties have emerged among my fiscal advisors, with some advocating for the ‘acquisition’ of funds from the Jewish population, and others pointing to the great wealth amassed by the Archbishop of Mainz, [SCOPE.sC('konrad').GetCharacterViewName], and sensing an opportunity."
  KOH_Pentecost.4.a:0 "I’m sure Konrad will understand."
  KOH_Pentecost.4.b:0 "Prepare the Writs of Taxation, [THIS.GetCouncillorPosition('councillor_steward').GetCouncillor.GetName]."
  KOH_Pentecost.4.c:0 "I will find other, more sensible means."

  KOH_Pentecost.5.t:0 "A Pious Plea"
  KOH_Pentecost.5.desc:0 "An understandably angry Konrad has sent an envoy to Lautern. \"... and you dare demand more from his holiness after he has already offered the burden of hosting such an event?\""
  KOH_Pentecost.5.a:0 "I promise Mainz will surely prosper!"
  KOH_Pentecost.5.a.tt:0 "Explain diplomatically that Konrad has to spend money to turn a profit."
  KOH_Pentecost.5.b:0 "It is no matter, my friends..."
  KOH_Pentecost.5.b.tt:0 "Perhaps funding could be obtained from Konrad through more… unconventional means, like adjusting the census records."
  KOH_Pentecost.5.c:0 "Tell Konrad that he has my goodwill."

  KOH_Pentecost.6.t:0 "A visit from a Lender"
  KOH_Pentecost.6.desc:0 "Unlike many other lords in Europe, since now, I have done little to undermine the Imperial Jewish population, but they were quick to react to my recent announcement of taxation. Before me stands a local jew, who pleads before me to lower these obligations, and offers his services if I were to comply."
  KOH_Pentecost.6.a:0 "His terms are acceptable."
  KOH_Pentecost.6.b:0 "I am not a walking charity."

  KOH_Pentecost.7.t:0 "A most esteemed guest?"
  KOH_Pentecost.7.desc:0 "The Archbishop of Mainz has made a visit in person with news of excitement. According to his own testimony, a papal envoy has relayed Lucius III’s wish to attend the diet in person, to engage in political talks regarding the status of Italy. Since his ascension as the voice of god on earth, there has been constant conflict between the two of us, and Konrad views this as a chance of reconciliation between our realms and an opportunity to sort out the Curia's claim on Matilda of Tuscany’s former territories. Many of my present secular advisors caution against the meeting, and suggest a need to hold a firm stance against the Papacy."
  KOH_Pentecost.7.a:0 "Express your support for the idea."
  KOH_Pentecost.7.a.tt:0 "You will get the chance to mend fences with the Pope once the Diet begins"
  KOH_Pentecost.7.b:0 "It is simple; I am the rightful liege of Italia."

  KOH_Pentecost.8.t:0 "Der Löwe"
  KOH_Pentecost.8.desc:0 "What Konrad didn’t tell me about was his open invitation of Heinrich Welf! The Lion has been invited from England, promised protection by the Archbishop. That fiend! He claims it is in the name of diplomacy against France. I can only tolerate so many adversaries at a single feast."
  KOH_Pentecost.8.a:0 "I trust your judgement, Konrad…"
  KOH_Pentecost.8.a.tt:0 "While the Archbishop has overstepped his boundaries, a meeting with Henry the Lion could prove beneficial, if not disastrous!"
  KOH_Pentecost.8.b:0 "You have overstepped your boundaries!"
  KOH_Pentecost.8.b.tt:0 "Some may consider it tyrannical, but this wanton behaviour could set a dangerous precedent if accepted."

  KOH_Pentecost.9.t:0 "An Ultimatum from Rome"
  KOH_Pentecost.9.desc:0 "The arrest of the Archbishop did not go as planned… that is to say, he was arrested, but news travelled quickly to Rome, and the Pope has sent an envoy once again northwards. Lucius, who had almost finished all of his preparations to travel across the alps, was enraged by the arrest of a cardinal with ‘little justification’, and demands he is released at once, with the ultimatum that he will not attend the diet otherwise, and reestablish previous hostilities."
  KOH_Pentecost.9.a:0 "This does not involve him!"
  KOH_Pentecost.9.b:0 "Very well; but Heinrich shall not attend."

  KOH_Pentecost.10.t:0 "Public Works"
  KOH_Pentecost.10.desc:0 "Exhaustive effort has been placed upon the shoulders of the labourers I have employed at Mainz, and a few final preparations are in order, particularly regarding the matter of infrastructure. Over 35,000 people are expected to attend, eclipsing the city’s population by two times! The question remains; what should be done to remedy the traffic?"
  KOH_Pentecost.10.a:0 "The current local infrastructure sufficies."
  KOH_Pentecost.10.b:0 "The pavement of the local paths is required."
  KOH_Pentecost.10.c:0 "The city should be expanded in itself!"

  KOH_Pentecost.1001.opening:0 "An Imperial Invite"
  KOH_Pentecost.1001.desc:0 "A Messenger has arrived in the court of [THIS.Capital.GetName] bearing the arms of the Emperor, Inviting us to attend the Mainz court festival set during the Pentecost."
  KOH_Pentecost.1001.a:0 "I shall Attend!"
  KOH_Pentecost.1001.b:0 "I shall sit this out."

  KOH_Pentecost.11.t:0 "Awestruck"
  KOH_Pentecost.11.desc:0 "My entire court has now temporarily located to Mainz for the upcoming diet, and upon our arrival at the gates, the party was greeted with the sight of a truly imperial city, worthy of the emperor's prescience. Construction on the newer district of Weisenau by the Rhine has yielded spectacular progress! Merchants have already gathered, selling foreign wares to labourers, who indulge in dates and pastries. Konrad greets me with a smile. \"Wonderful job my liege. Please, accept my gratitude for the funding of these works!\""
  KOH_Pentecost.11.a:0 "Why thank you!"

  KOH_Pentecost.12.t:0 "A Reception"
  KOH_Pentecost.12.desc:0 "This afternoon, Mainz was certainly a bustle, with horse carts hailing from across Germany bringing with them lords, ladies, wares and tales of yore. The worry of a plague was founded on reality, as tens of thousands of guests wandered the narrow streets of the seat of the Archbishop’s domain; but little did cynicism dwell within the collective consciousness of those visiting. Scholars from across Europe have come to record the events, and kilometres of tents line the outside of the city walls. The reception of all of status began at the imposing St. Martin’s Cathedral; It was not long before a dispute arose between the hundreds of attendees! [SCOPE.sC('count_hainaut').GetCharacterViewName] has been offered the status of swordbearer of myself, but some argue he is not worthy of such an honour! [SCOPE.sC('duke_lorraine').GetCharacterViewName] has been presented as an alternative candidate for the role."
  KOH_Pentecost.12.a:0 "The choice is obvious! [SCOPE.sC('count_hainaut').GetFirstName]!"
  KOH_Pentecost.12.b:0 "Perhaps the opposition has a point."

  KOH_Pentecost.13.t:0 "Papal Concordat"
  KOH_Pentecost.13.desc:0 "The First segment of the diet has been devoted to the promised concordat between I and Pope Lucius III. The major question that longed upon all attendees was the status of Matilda of Tuscany’s succession. The Pope wishes for ownership over Tuscany, and concession to papal demands. While a great blow to the Empire’s authority, conceding could end the long dispute between the Empire and the Latin clergy. A resolution seems unlikely to be made, unless one side concedes. Your chancellor, [THIS.GetCouncillorPosition.GetCharacter.GetName], however, views an opportunity; he suggests going forth with a compromise where Tuscany remains Imperial territory, and the Papacy receives two-tenths of Italy’s Imperial revenue. He claims this would appease both parties."
  KOH_Pentecost.13.a:0 "It is perhaps best we bend the knee…"
  KOH_Pentecost.13.b:0 "We shall attempt at mediation."
  KOH_Pentecost.13.c:0 "Demand the Pope gives up his claims."

  KOH_Pentecost.14.t:0 "Dirty Dealing"
  KOH_Pentecost.14.desc:0 "... you invite me here to mock me? Divine claims are not to be waived away by someone who thinks they can conquer god!\" Lucius has gone visibly scarlet, as the whole room holds their breath awaiting his conclusion, which arrives precisely with his entourage promptly leaving for Rome. This… does not bode well."
  KOH_Pentecost.14.a:0 "Oh well."

  KOH_Pentecost.15.t:0 "An Unthinkable Prospect"
  KOH_Pentecost.15.desc:0 "It had been two years since the Lion of Saxony had stepped foot in Germany since his political exile, but it was now that he stood before the very man that disdained him. Acting as an emissary for his father-in-law, Henry II, he views an alliance between the nations of England and the Empire to be mutually beneficial. This comes at a cost to us, however, as Henry Welf expects his imperial ban to be lifted, and his Saxon territories returned!"
  KOH_Pentecost.15.a:0 "In the interest of the nation, I shall comply."
  KOH_Pentecost.15.a.tt:0 "Perhaps reconciliation is possible…"
  KOH_Pentecost.15.b:0 "Who does this fool think he is?"
  KOH_Pentecost.15.b.tt:0 "Once conquered - always a traitor."

  KOH_Pentecost.16.t:0 "Ecclesiastical Squabble"
  KOH_Pentecost.16.desc:0 "The delicacies are laid out upon the table in courtly fashion. All sorts of Persian spices were passed around generously, alongside spreads smeared upon the clearest bread on the Rhine. Plums stewed in rose water; civets of hare covered in fine German Sauce. Cuts of meats were passed on by rank down the table, and yet those with the least splendour still ate like kings from a deer pie! Heavenly delights, surely, and yet some are not content to revel in the moment; Konrad, the Abbot of Fulda demands the right to sit to the left of me, a right only usually granted to the Archbishop of Cologne. It is not surprising therefore, that Philipp of Cologne is in utter horror over the challenge to his position as the most righteous among the Imperial clergy. Now, they both look to me to sort this out."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.a:0 "It is the right of Cologne, of course."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.a.tt:0 "Traditions need to be retained, and angering the Archbishop may be a danger to my position!"
  KOH_Pentecost.16.b:0 "Why not? I see no issue."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.b.tt:0 "The Abbot of Fulda has proved time and time again his status as an equal of the Archbishop of Cologne, and this should manifest physically as well."
  KOH_Pentecost.16.c:0 "I’m sure they can resolve it themselves; I’m hungry!"
  KOH_Pentecost.16.c.tt:0 "This is obviously not a crown issue; and you could eat an entire boar!"

  KOH_Pentecost.17.t:0 "Making a Scene"
  KOH_Pentecost.17.desc:0 "It was at that precise moment that Philipp shook his head backwards, perhaps in surprise or doubt, and raised his eyebrows; it was not only the Abbey of Fulda that had been de-legitimizing the stature of his position, but now the Emperor himself! Needless to say, the fine craftsmanship of his chair has all but gone to waste as he crudely stood out of his seat, and proclaimed his desire to retire to his chambers early."
  KOH_Pentecost.17.a:0 "Instruct that an apology be delivered to his chambers."
  KOH_Pentecost.17.b:0 "I stated it truly and plainly."

  KOH_Pentecost.18.t:0 "Accolades"
  KOH_Pentecost.18.desc:0 "A grand ceremony was called for, as the Emperor conferred knighthood upon his sons and some of the most chivalrous squires; great many gifts were given to those who received such an honour, with many lords wishing not to look avaricious. This was followed by the beginning of the gyrum, at which the many knights were to show their skills in swinging shields and banners upon horseback. The top five knights in the realm shall receive bountiful reward as well."
  KOH_Pentecost.18.a:0 "I shall attend, of course!"
  KOH_Pentecost.18.b:0 "I shall watch from the stands."

  KOH_Pentecost.19.t:0 "A Joust"
  KOH_Pentecost.19.desc:0 "The gyrum completed, several other games have been planned to take place; next was a joust, a more fancifully modern hastilude from Normandy. Mail was distributed among the participants, and warm blooded chargers were handlers with diligence."
  KOH_Pentecost.19.a:0 "Saddle my horse!"
  KOH_Pentecost.19.b:0 "I’ve had quite enough, I think."

  KOH_Pentecost.20.t:0 "Ingelheim"
  KOH_Pentecost.20.desc:0 "To end the events, a grand melee tournament, the most barbaric and eastern of all events, and yet the greatest tradition of them all, was to be fought at Ingelheim, near Mainz. There have been reports from late visitors of a brewing storm coming from Frankish lands, and many advise not to continue, lest the priests make a fuss."
  KOH_Pentecost.20.a:0 "We will try our luck."

  KOH_Pentecost.21.t:0 "The Grand Melee"
  KOH_Pentecost.21.desc:0 "The weather is little matter, if not slightly damp; the final of the three events has begun! Hand-to-Hand combat is quite dangerous, but this tournament holds the greatest award of merit to those who overcome the thousands of others who strive for such prestige!"
  KOH_Pentecost.21.desc.Fred:0 "The weather is little matter, if not slightly damp; the final of the three events has begun! Hand-to-Hand combat is quite dangerous, but this tournament holds the greatest award of merit to those who overcome the thousands of others who strive for such prestige. [THIS.GetCouncilPosition('marshal').GetCharacter.GetFirstName] advises not to partake due to my age."
  KOH_Pentecost.21.a:0 "Let's join the fun!"
  KOH_Pentecost.21.a.Fred:0 "I am not a feeble man!"
  KOH_Pentecost.21.b:0 "I am content to enjoy from afar."
  KOH_Pentecost.21.b.Fred:0 "I am content to enjoy from afar."

  KOH_Pentecost.21.A:0 "You do much better than you expected."

  KOH_Pentecost.21.D:0 "You are wounded."
  KOH_Pentecost.21.D.points:0 ""

  KOH_Pentecost.22.t:0 "Divine Mandate"
  KOH_Pentecost.22.desc:0 "What a disaster; it seems all must retire early, as the fields stench themselves in the tears of the sky. The common people follow the priests judgement, of course, and they say the games mustn’t continue lest tragedy take place. Some spineless vassals have been content with the matter, although, too have such a grandiose event cancelled by nature… It would be deceitful to say I wasn’t disappointed."
  KOH_Pentecost.22.a:0 "Under the tents…"

  KOH_Pentecost.23.t:0 "A Sweet Farewell"
  KOH_Pentecost.23.desc:0 "Just as grand of a procession as an entrance, a steady flow of wagons dispersed themselves among the countryside, bringing with them a great deal of clamour in all directions. The diet has officially ended, and the scholars shall be surely occupied on the matter for the meanwhile."
  KOH_Pentecost.23.a:0 "Very good."
  KOH_Pentecost.23.a.tt:0 "With this, the Diet of the Pentecost comes to a close."
