 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.1.t: "The Red Bearded Crusader"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.1.d: "My good men, you think I am old. A vestige of our proud past, to be masked in gold and sat on gilded thrones while the indiscriminate hammer of the infidel terrorizes our brethren, good Christians all. And now the Saracen marches on Jerusalem itself! \n\nMy son always dismissed my old stories of Great King Conrad’s campaigns. But now he will face the Turkmen blight himself. He will know of the treacheries of the Greek. While there is still strength in my old bones, and colour in my beard, I’ll make the son of Swabia a crusader! Send the envoys and light the roads, the Knight of Christ marches once again."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.1.a: "To Jerusalem!"
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.2.t: "Departure From the HRE"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.2.d: "We passed a township where my son led the cavalry scouts in preparation for our procession. He came back, smiling ear to ear. Young and old alike had prayed at his feet, and recited his name in Holy prayers. Children begged my officers to enlist in the fight for the Holy Land. \n\n My men march firm and orderly. The people gather and cheer in every town they pass. Not even in Conrad’s time was the will of our people this strong. This single-minded."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.2.a: "On the way to the Dardanelles."
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.3.t: "Arrival at Hungary"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.3.d: "The Hungarian king has been hospitable and true to our cause. His princes admire my legacy and believe in my quest for vengeance. They have promised me support and men all the way through. \n\nMeanwhile, honest men of Christ still pour in day and night from east to west, proclaiming me their champion. There is opportunity here to grow in rank and column."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.3.a: "Gather more crusaders here, and then move on."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.3.b: "There is no time to lose."
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.4.t: "Arrival at Byzantium"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.4.d: "We’ve arrived in Byzantium. The rebels and skirmishers pester us with daily raids. The Greek have been fickle with support and markets are hard to find. \n\nThis has not broken my men’s spirit. Quite the opposite! My son forages and secures camp with the vigilance of an owl. We march with gritted teeth and have bent the locals to our will. We will pass through with or without support, it matters not."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.4.a: "Great!"
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.5.t: "The German Emperor Arrives"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.5.d: "The red-bearded, German fool is intent on his suicide mission! His envoys were hard enough to appease and now he comes marching through our homes as if we owe him our supper. Must we sacrifice our relationships to cater to his demands? The people come first and hard decisions must be made. Either trust the German’s intention and haste, or put our foot down on this trespassing."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.5.a: "No not more Crusaders! Barbarossa I don't want that filthy army in my city, turn back at once!"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.5.b: "Allow them passage through Constantinople."
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.6.t: "A Passage Through Constantinople"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.6.d:1 "As my councilors had surmised, the false Emperor of Constantinople has denied our Holy march. I have no choice but to find an alternate route. My bravehearts on scout have been given word and prepare the roads for us. We must hurry, lest the wily Greek finds another way to obstruct our journey."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.6.d.alternate:0 "The gates of Constantinople have opened to our tired men. Either we have misjudged the Greek or this is a trap to entrench us further in these lands. Whatever may come, my men march orderly and prepared. Onwards!"   
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.6.a: "The crossing at Gallipoli then."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.6.b: "Through Constantinople."
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.7.t: "Crossing Through Constantinople"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.7.d: "The people of this ancient city trouble us little. But their smiles are guarded and the wealthy watch us with distrustful eyes. By God! How these proud people have decayed in their greed for earthly possessions. Our Knights of Christ will set a noble example for these lost souls."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.7.a: "Nothing shall stop our Crusade!"
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.8.t: "An Abandoned House?"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.8.d: "Our eyes drifted to the majestic mountains of Aksehir, unaware of the surrounding horsemen that trickled in from the northern plains and from around abandoned barns. It wasn't until they were in bowshot that we realized they were combatants, barreling towards us; a horde of savage Turks screaming our death! \n\nThey pelted us with arrows and clashed with our bannerline but the battle ended as quickly as it began and, God be praised, they could not break through our ranks. Still breathing heavy from action, my officers inform me of the routing enemy. We have prevailed today, but some of our valiant knights have fallen. We must not become so easy a prey as this."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.8.a: "A Saracen Ambush!"
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.9.t: "Skirmishes with the Turks"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.9.d: "As predicted, the ambush wasn't the last of them. Their captain, Qutb Al Din, continues to harass our frontline throughout the day. They come in waves and at odd times. The deadliest rush began just before sunrise, and they were gone before we could see them. Bodies of my men, riddled with arrows, obstruct our path. \n\nWe pause to bury them and give them proper rites. But many times, we had no choice but to pay the locals to bury our dead. God curse the infidels and hit them with a terrible blight!""
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.9.a: "Bloody Seljuks!"
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.10.t: "Crossing the Saleph River"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.10.d: "The crashing waves of the ocean greet us. A chorus of angels, striking the ground in welcome and shouting victory, victory, victory! Like Moses and his faithful, we will cross this river and enter the Holy Land."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.10.a: "This should be easy."
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.11.t: "Barbarossa Drowns"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.11.d: "The Red Bearded Crusader is dead! Our Barbossa, our beloved Emperor, cannot be revived after a fall in the river. How cruel is this fate? Pray that his sons, his brothers, and his noble men stay strong in the face of this defeat. God works in mysterious ways. May He reward the Knight of Christ and open the gates of Heaven for him. \n\nAmen."
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.11.a: "The Christian heart grieves his death."
 
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.12.t: "Barbarossa Arrives in the Holy Land"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.12.d: "Against all odds, we have arrived. In the face of treachery, in the face savagery, the Knight of Christ descends upon on the Holy Land. The Ayyubid princes will not sleep another day while we march from town to town. All the mosques will be emptied, and the infidel's abode will be razed. Nigh is the time of sword and axe. Nigh is the time of the Holy Cross!"
 KoH_barbarossa_crusade.12.a: "Deus Vult!"
