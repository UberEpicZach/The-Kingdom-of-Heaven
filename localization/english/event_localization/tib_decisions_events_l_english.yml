 major_decisions_mosque_seville.3.desc: "Alas, the project of a great Masjid in the luminous metropolis of Seville has finally been put unto completion! Now, the project started by the scholarly second Almohad caliph, Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, can begin its operation as a complete mosque with the full observation of the Jumu'ah (Friday) prayer, with the addition of a great minaret for the Adhan to be called loudly! Perhaps this mighty minaret might be a landmark of this city in the future... \n\nNonetheless, the architect behind such project has sought an audience before me. Apparently, [architect.GetSheHe] would like to join my court for perhaps even more grand-scale projects in the future. \n\n"If you were to let me join you, guarantee for me that you shall patronize all of my works in time ahead", said the architect."
