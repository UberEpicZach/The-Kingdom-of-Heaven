 KOH_guelphs_ghibellines_filler.0012.desc: "The market was unsually live this morning as I stroll through my city. The reason for it became clear as I saw a large crowd gathered around a merchant and a mercenary arguing. While the argument was over the price of a item, under the surface simmered the Guelphs and Ghibellines conflict. The Merchants were largely supporters of the Guelphs, who saw the Emperor as a threat to their prosperity. While the Mercenaries may have seen the Emperor as a prospect of employment. Also many of the mercenaries would of been from more rural families, where their land was under threat from the Papcy. "
