 KoH_balians_adventure.1.t:0 "Love Lost"
 KoH_balians_adventure.1.d:0 "It has been a week since the-- the incident. The love of my life, the only woman in my life...\n\nWe were lovers ever since we had learned what it meant to love. We had grown up side by side, born under the hands of the same midwife and raised in the same tiny village. And as she tended our land, I would work in the smithy, my trade at heart. Unlike many other blacksmiths in France, I wholly owned my shop, as did my father before me. \n\nWe spent our days apart. I would toil for weeks before the forge to earn the moments lying by her side. In our nights together, we had been trying for a child. Just as it seemed it would be to no avail, she announced she had quickened. I think often of that calm, peaceful night, of that moment, of the light in her face and the tears of joy streaking down her cheeks. Then the memory falters, and I must remember the other tears.\n\nIn the following months, we were filled with days of joy which outshone any petty drugeries, to the point that I felt in my heart an intensity that I had yet to experience. As if I had fallen in love with her for the first time. Her belly grew, as did the child inside her, and active the child was, kicking away within her. She fashioned the swaddling, and I hired a basket for a cradle.\n\nPerhaps God did not intend for us to live this eternal bliss. One morning, the pains began. Under those same wizened hands of the midwife, the child came, but it did not draw breath. From that very moment on, my wife was never the same. From morning to night without a meal to eat, nor a word to speak, she had no more love nor care to give. People whispered of the stillborn, of the Devil in our midst.\n\nPerhaps I abandoned her, when I returned to the familiar heat of my forge. Our cottage, I thought at the time, was more than I could bear. So it was that the neighbor found my wife with the rope around her neck..."

 KoH_balians_adventure.2.t:0 "Unexpected Visitors"
 KoH_balians_adventure.2.d:0 "I am a different man now, a man without reason, a man without a wife or child. If I were another man, I might have sought God, but I think God has abandoned this place. Grief gnaws at me; work is a balm. The singlewomen cast their eyes in my direction, but I do not look back.\n\nIt is a day like any other. The bishop has requested my wrought work for his cathedral in Chartres. At mid-afternoon I break, feeling as though my flesh is cooking in the sweltering forge. I will resume when the air is cooler, and plan to work long into the night. My apprentice peeks his head around the door, looking tense. He tells me that the king’s party has been seen on the road heading for our small settlement, escorting knights who have returned from the Levant. I am profoundly confused, but make some reply about them wanting to see the makings of the grand church."

 KoH_balians_adventure.3.t:0 "A Sword for a Knight"
 KoH_balians_adventure.3.d:0 "A squire to the Crusaders awakens me in the dead of night.  The eldest one in their party has returned from the castle of my lord having heard good things about my steel.\n\nThe old knight requests a specialized sword and offers me its particular diagram. It does not surprise me when I learn he is the natural brother of my lord; the quality of his speech suggests a man who would belong in court, even if his bearing demonstrates he is most comfortable in armor. While I pour over the pages of design, I catch him staring at me with an expression I cannot place. Is it… fondness? Whatever it is, he makes me uneasy.\n\nHe turns as though he will leave, and stops, abruptly admitting that he knew my namesake, the old blacksmith. Softly, he adds he knew my mother. He came all this way with the purpose of confession. My insides seize, imagining that he took my sweet mother by force, but he speaks with such kindness of her memory. My father died years ago, yet this man now claims me to be his son, and offers a place for me with him in Jerusalem.\n\nHere there is a grave that I must tend. I turn him away. He says in parting, "I am sorry for your troubles. God protect you. Jerusalem is easy to find. You come to where the men speak Italian… then continue until they speak something else. We go by Messina. Good-bye.""
 KoH_balians_adventure.3.a: "What does Jerusalem have for me? Nothing."
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.4.t:0 "Raging Fires"
 KoH_balians_adventure.4.d:0 "I put my anger into the steel. Was the crusader my father? Would a man of his rank and prestige speak falsely? Had my antagonizing brother known this truth? As if summoned by this thought, Michel appears. Immediately, he drives at me. "The village does not want you! When the old lord is dead, they will drive you out. When the bishop is dead, it is certain."\n\n"And you take my property?" My response comes quickly to my tongue. We have had this fight before. Our late father-- the man I thought of as my father-- had seen that Michel’s talents lay one way and mine another.\n\nHe cringes. "The Church."\n\n"You." I wish to hear none of it. He has been happy enough to take the salary from the old lord, to enjoy the improved status of a cleric, but evidently that is not enough.\n\n"They would have taken you to Jerusalem. Away from... all this." He wheedles, increasingly excited, "I arranged it. I had them come here. I swear to you... you will have no peace so long as you stay here. No man ever needed a new world more. Imagine your sin and pain erased. All." I put a hammer to another glowing hot billet. Each is pounded thin enough to resemble its final form. Usually I make scrollwork for the bishop. Today, I make swords.\n\n"If you take the Crusade... you may relieve your wife's position in Hell. I-- I put it delicately. She was a suicide. She is in Hell." I pull the form from the forge to quench it. My stomach churns. He slips close enough that I can smell his foul breath when he jeers: "Though what she does there without a head..."\n\nReflected in the light of the forge I see gold glinting at his throat. I know to whom that cross belonged. I made it for her myself. My blood boils! God! The billet is in my hand. I drive it straight through him. My brother gurgles and screams as he falls into the open forge. His clothes catch, he flails-- I think only to save a piece of my wife. I reach in for the cross, grasp it so tightly the flesh of my palm boils, endeavor to rip it from the thong strung around his neck. Michel is lifted free by my efforts-- wild-eyed in death. He had mutilated her, stole from her shroud, lied to and manipulated me. I feel oddly calm as my brother’s death throes set fire to my shop.\n\nHe was right about one thing: no man ever needed a new world more. Before the alarm is raised, I unhitch my horse and flee."

 KoH_balians_adventure.5.t:0 "Pursuing Godfrey"
 KoH_balians_adventure.5.d:0 "Night has fallen on the French countryside. It is nearly my fifth day riding since my departure from town, and despite my horse's speed I have yet to run into the crusading party. I decide to take a night off from sleeping beneath the common larch and pay dearly for a night within a highway inn.\n\nIn the morning, I move into the inn's communal tavern, a place jostling with folk from all over. Knights, probable bandits, would-be adventurers, and locals-- I question many, as discreetly as I can manage. A few have heard of my quarry, and I learn that they have passed this way.\n\nThere grows a commotion from without. A few of the more questionable guests duck toward the back passage. Through the front come two knights bearing the banners of Chartres, seeking the arrest of "Balian, Blacksmith of Chartres, son of his namesake!" Slowly I move, keeping to the wall, kicking myself that I had not moved sooner, and grateful only that none here could connect that name to this face.\n\nAnother convoy of banner knights is arriving as I saddle my horse. I take its lead and we walk for the first quarter mile. When I am finally out of sight I ride as fast and hard as the road will allow -- I have to make distance between myself and these knights."
 KoH_balians_adventure.5.a: "Ride Faster!"

 KoH_balians_adventure.6.t:0 "Sparring After Breakfast"
 KoH_balians_adventure.6.d:0 ""Have you come to kill me?" The man Godfrey -- lately my father-- asks wryly, as I finally catch up with the group. \n\nNo, I say, but there is blood on my hands. This, he agrees, we had in common. Was it true then that in Jerusalem the sins of a man could be purged? That there might be some relief for my late wife? This, he did not know, but offered to help me discover.\n\nMy new companions are like none I’ve ever met. I had fought in war before, and thought I knew it. I had built great engines of siege. That experience paled in comparison to a few weeks training with Godfrey and his men. \n\nOn a morning like any other, frost nipping the air, we break camp in Toulouse, perhaps a day from the border. Just as Godfrey and I are taking the final swings of our sparring match, we hear hoofbeats on the forest path. \n\nAtop a horse, and backed by four other knights, is Hugues de Puiset, the son of the old lord of Chartres, acting as his father’s sheriff. "Uncle,” he says, “I have come far for the blacksmith. I see he is in your care, but he has murdered a village priest -- By the order of the archbishop, I have the right to take him."\n\nI step forward to surrender, but Godfrey stills me with his hand. He winks at me, but his eyes are like ice. A dozen crossbowmen appear in the thick of the woods around us."
 KoH_balians_adventure.6.a: "To the perimeter!"
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.7.t:0 "Ambush"
 KoH_balians_adventure.7.d:0 "Within seconds of Godfrey's refusal, Puiset's men descend on the camp. They are not here to capture. They are here to kill. I get the feeling it is not just me they are after. \n\nMy father mounts his horse to pursue his nephew. The crusaders clash with the french soldiers in the thick of the trees behind me, and quickly I see a soldier charging towards me, weapon in hand."
 KoH_balians_adventure.7.a: "Swing from above!"

 KoH_balians_adventure.8.t:0 "Swordplay Before Lunch"
 KoH_balians_adventure.8.d:0 "Glad am I that I took to Godfrey’s training, for it might save my life! Parrying each blow from the man at my front, I lure him into making a swing just too low, giving me an opening. I deflect his sword and project my blade in the weak point between his mail and helmet. He falls. \n\nI take a moment to glance in the chaos. A big german fights to his last breath with two crossbow bolts protruding his body. Godfrey in his pursuit had been shot, too. Still he keeps his mount and swings, cleaving the skull of Puiset - killing him instantly."
 KoH_balians_adventure.8.a: "A fitting end!"

 KoH_balians_adventure.9.t:0 "Swordplay Before Lunch"
 KoH_balians_adventure.9.d:0 "Glad am I that I took to Godfrey’s training, for it might save my life! I parry each blow, but my opponent is calculated and strong. My fingers ring numb. Suddenly he does not advance with his sword but with his shoulder, and I overbalance, falling flat on my back. My sword lands several feet out of reach. \n\nI am certain that this is my last moment. A certain particular hospitaller knight appears on horseback, fast as the light on his steed, and glistening in the sunrays like an angel from above. Without flair or notice, the Hospitaller separates the head from the body of the man standing above me. I catch my breath; the man salutes and turns to the chase. \n\nPuiset is dead by Godfrey’s sword. We have won, but at a steep cost-- three quarters of our friends are lost, and Godfrey is badly wounded."
 KoH_balians_adventure.9.a: "My back!"
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.10.t:0 "The Road From France"
 KoH_balians_adventure.10.d:0 "I hear it called la Via Francigena-- the road from France-- though the pilgrims we encounter along the way come from many kingdoms. It is many miles through mountainous countryside, farther than I have ever travelled in all my days added together. \n\nWe spend a week in Rome, to my mind the center of beauty and civilization, though overly crowded with fetid travellers like ourselves. The Hospitiller delights in showing me her crumbling jewels. He dryly remarks on the despoilment of the Sancta Maria ad Martyres, which had once been a pagan temple, and is still grander than my cathedral in Chartres. \n\nGodfrey guides us through what he calls a Colosseum. Here hundreds of people live together in crowded apartments, and merchants ply their wares. I am most interested in the water pipes, and spent far too much time wondering at the engineering. "You know this place well," I observe. \n\n"I left France when I was a boy," he says. "There was no place for me but in a monastary. But I had a cousin a dozen years my senior who was to be the Count of Jaffa-- in Jerusalem. He sent me ahead to make preparations in Rome. When he did not arrive, I spent two years on these streets waiting."  \n\n"How did you survive?" \n\nHe smirks. "I learned to fight. I learned the language. The Count found it amusing to say later that I was his Italian servant. But my efforts were rewarded. I had not yet made my majority when he named me his constable." \n\n"What happened to him?" \n\nThe Hospitaller interjects: "Ten years before the loss of Edessa, the Count got into a dispute with King Foulques over some secret matter. Some say it concerned the Queen, who was the count’s dearest relation. A pointless war followed." \n\n"I was a pissant, placed in command and expected to wage war against my king. The lord of Ramla-- my father-in-law-- showed me the better path. For this, the king awarded me Ibelin." \n\n"Whereas the Count was murdered in the streets," our friend concludes. \n\nGodfrey turns away from me and coughs. I cannot say that the color ever returns to his cheeks. His wound, though mended on the outside, has festered where the bolt shattered his ribs. Blood and phlegm stain his cloths. \n\nThough he can scarcely keep his mount, he insists we leave Rome. By the time we reach the castle of the Hospitaller Knights, he has to be carried on a litter. It is in this great camp of knights, pilgrims, and clergymen that I first meet Guy of Lusignan. He professes his great surprise in learning of me, for all of Godfrey’s rightful born children in Jerusalem are dead."
 KoH_balians_adventure.10.a:0 "Dear God above, I pray for his health."
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.11.t:0 "Messina"
 KoH_balians_adventure.11.d:0 "Messina, port to the Holy Land-- to me it seems like the edge of the world. The sea is the brightest blue-green. The streets are lined with banking houses; the warehouses are full of exotic goods. With the few words of Italian I have picked up, I hear merchants from Venice and Sicily complain about the crowded throngs. Our ship will be ready to depart in a few days, but that is the last thing on my mind. \n\nGodfrey is failing. His skin is clammy and gray, and he wheezes for every breath. Our friend moves him to a house of his order, where he can be more comfortable. "
 KoH_balians_adventure.11.a:0 "A few more days..."

 KoH_balians_adventure.12.t:0 "Rise" 
 KoH_balians_adventure.12.d:0 "I am shook awake by our companion -- The Hospitaller Knight. He rushes me to a nearby chapel. Within stands my father, as pale in the face as ever. "Get on your knees," instructs the Hospitaller, and I do as he commands. \n\nGodfrey is lifted to standing by two knights, wobbling on his feet as he rasps, "Be without fear, in the face of your enemies. Be brave and upright that God may love thee, and speak the truth always, even if it leads to your death. Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong-- that is your oath. Rise a knight, and a baron of Ibelin." With the last of his energy, he grabs my hand and places upon my finger a noble ring. As he tries to hand me his sword, he collapses into my arms. "Defend the king. If the king is no more... protect the people.""
 KoH_balians_adventure.12.a:0 "Father..."

 KoH_balians_adventure.13.t:0 "The Sea of Fate"
 KoH_balians_adventure.13.d:0 "It has been days since the departure from Messina, and I cannot stop thinking of Godfrey. I imagine my life if he had stayed in France when I was a child. I try to picture my life as if he took me to Ibelin twenty years sooner… \n\nMy Célia would have married someone else. A better man than me.\n\n If only Godfrey was still alive to show me the holy land as he intended. The ship creaks. I hear the quartermaster cry out! "Brace for the wave!""
 KoH_balians_adventure.13.a:0 ""HOLD O--""
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.14.t:0 "The Sands"
 KoH_balians_adventure.14.d:0 "My back feels like it has splintered in two. I awake with hot sand beneath me and the sun above. I have washed up with the shipwreck alone. Well-- mostly alone. A fine-- if frantic-- horse shakes free of the debris and thunders past me on the beach. \n\nI spend the next hours searching for fresh water. By sheer luck, I find an oasis-- and the horse. But we are not alone. At the horizon I spot two figures riding towards me."
 KoH_balians_adventure.14.a:0 "What do they want?"
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.15.t:0 "The Oasis"
 KoH_balians_adventure.15.d:0 "One of the riders calls out to me in perfect French: "He says that is his horse!" \n\nI am baffled by the accusation. "Why would it be his horse?" I call back. \n\n"Because it is on his land!" \n\n"I took this horse from the sea!" I try to explain. \n\nThe stranger translates my words into the local tongue for the other man. They confer for a moment, and then he says, "He says you are a great liar, and he will fight you because you are a liar.""
 KoH_balians_adventure.15.a:0 ""I have no desire to fight.""
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.16.t:0 "The Oasis"
 KoH_balians_adventure.16.d:0 ""Then you must give him the horse!" says the stranger with amused exasperation. \n\nI know if I am left on foot, I will die on these sands. Reluctantly, I draw my sword and take the stance Godfrey taught me. The second man flings a spear in my direction. I barely parry! "Fight me fairly," I shout in frustration, as the spear sings off my blade. \n\n"Why should he?" scoffs the stranger. \n\n"I am the Baron of Ibelin," I declare, for the first time in my life. If I say it enough, I might actually believe it. \n\n "He says the Baron of Ibelin is old. He knew him-- at Damascus.""
 KoH_balians_adventure.16.a:0 ""I am the new one.""

 KoH_balians_adventure.17.t:0 "The Oasis"
 KoH_balians_adventure.17.d:0 "The angry Saracen dismounts from his horse and draws a beautiful sword. It gleams in the harsh light of the desert sun. I must place my trust in my own steel, and the lessons my father gave me, if I want to survive. He chops at me wildly, with none of the grace I expect from the owner of such a sword. \n\n"Stop! Stop!" cries the interpreter, no longer enjoying this game."
 KoH_balians_adventure.17.a:0 "If I stop, I will die."
 KoH_balians_adventure.17.a.tt: "You duel the stranger for your life."


 KoH_balians_adventure.18.t:0 "The Oasis"
 KoH_balians_adventure.18.d:0 ""You have taken it very well that I have killed your master." \n\nThe man is oddly peaceful at the end of my sword. "It was the end of his time. All is as God wills it. Now finish it." \n\nI lift my arm to finish the task... and something stays my hand. He did not seek my death. Why should I seek his? You stare out across the sands.
 KoH_balians_adventure.18.a:0 "God wills it!"
 KoH_balians_adventure.18.b:0 ""Take me to Jerusalem.""
 KoH_balians_adventure.18.a.TT:0 "You face the desert alone."
 KoH_balians_adventure.18.b.TT:0 "You have a guide."

 KoH_balians_adventure.19.t:0 "The Oasis"
 KoH_balians_adventure.19.d:0 ""Stop!" screams the mounted man when I am thrown to the sand. "Enough of this!" He barks out a string of commands to the warrior. \n\nI learn that the interpreter is not the servant, but the master. These lands are his! He tells me of the peace between his lord Saladin, and my king Baudouin, and that he will not be the one to break the treaty. He points me in the direction of Jerusalem with a skin of water... and without the horse."

 KoH_balians_adventure.20.d:0 "Jerusalem is like nothing I could have pictured. I have been to Rome, I have seen great works, but in the sight of it I am truly humbled. I wonder if I will find God here. "Your quality will be known among your enemies, before ever you meet them, my friend," smiles the interpreter when I offer him the horse in payment for his services. I stop the first old man I see on the road and ask for the place where Christ was crucified. He points to a dome on a high hill above us. \n\nI make the pilgrimage to Calvary. Though I am hot and tired, this is little compared to the suffering of the man who once walked this path. At the top, I bury my wife's cross among the rocks. Will God speak to me?"
