 game_concept_investiture_contests: "Investiture Controversy"
 game_concept_investiture_contest_desc: "The Investiture Controversy began when a group within the church, members of the \"Gregorian Reform\", decided to rebel against the rule of simony by forcefully taking the power of [investiture|E] from the ruling secular power, i.e., the Holy Roman Emperor, and placing that power wholly within control of the church,\nThe Gregorian reformers knew this would not be possible so long as the emperor maintained the ability to appoint the pope, so their first step was to forcibly gain the papacy from the control of the emperor. in 1059 a church council in Rome declared that leaders of the nobility would have no part in the selection of popes, and created the College of Cardinals as a body of electors made up entirely of church officials.\n\nThe Investiture Controversy continued for several decades as each succeeding pope tried to diminish imperial power by stirring up revolt in Germany. These revolts were gradually successful. Henry IV was succeeded upon his death in 1106 by his son Henry V who renounced some of the rights of investiture with the Concordat of Worms\n\nAlthough offically finished with the Concordat of Worms, the conflicts with the supporters ([guelphs|E]) of the pope would reignite with the death of Henry V, whose successor Lothair II placed himself under the Pope's overlordship and ceded to the Pope all Imperial rights out of fear of the Salians' powerful in-laws the Staufers. \n\nWar broke out in Germany between those who supported the Staufers, the [ghibellines|E] and those who were aligned to the Pope, the [guelphs|E]. Upon Lothair's death the Staufer Conrad III was elected, while Lothair's heir Henry the Proud of the House of Welf continued fighting the Staufers. \n\nThe effects of these conflicts are still felt throughout Italy and Germany as Emperor Frederick Barbarossa has shown his determination to project his imperial rights of power over the Italian City states, and therefore the papacy."

 game_concept_erfurt_latrine_disaster_desc: "Historically, conflict erupted between Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was the Archbishop of Mainz, and Ludwig III, the Landgrave of Thuringia. It’s unclear exactly what prompted the conflict, but it most likely had to do with a land dispute or issues over land control. \n\nWhatever the problem was, it’s believed that King Heinrich VI wanted to settle the conflict between the two men once and for all. As he made his way through the territory, he called for a meeting involving a number of the region’s nobles and high-ranking officials. Some may have been expected to act as mediators during the negotiations. \n\nLittle did the king or his men know that the meeting would make such an unfortunate splash.\n\nBut as the meeting in July 1184 kicked off, the room’s floor suddenly collapsed into the monastery’s latrine. \n\nAt least 60 nobles died in the incident, but it’s been estimated that the number may have been closer to 100. Ludwig, whose dispute with the archbishop had been the focus of the meeting, survived purely by chance, The king and the archbishop, meanwhile, also survived clinging to the iron rails of a window for dear life until they were rescued. \n\nIt’s hard to say for sure whether the rich noblemen who died in the Erfurt latrine disaster had been killed by the fall itself or by being suffocated by the pool of filth they fell into."

  game_concept_collegeofcardinals: "College of Cardinals"
  game_concept_college: "College of Cardinals"
  game_concept_collegeofcardinals_desc: "There exists a college which comprises 9 cardinals. Cardinals are appointed by the Pope from among the clergy of Catholic Europe. Candidates with greater piety, greater age, greater learning, virtuous traits, secular power, favourable relations with the Pope, and the current culture of Rome/The Pope are preferred. Candidates are immediately appointed upon the death of a cardinal or upon the accession of one of the nine to the Papacy. Secular rulers can assign money to the campaign fund of the most promising cardinal candidate in their realm, thus making this vassal bishop more likely to be made into a cardinal."
