  CrusaderStateEvents.1.desc: "My men storm the walls of [countyforloc.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], and finally take the last proper bastion of the [duchyforloc.GetNameNoTooltip]. If I settled my men around the area they could probably support the ongoing Crusade for the [target_kingdom.GetName] and help us claim victory, but the Pope will not be pleased if I unrightfully take these lands for myself."
