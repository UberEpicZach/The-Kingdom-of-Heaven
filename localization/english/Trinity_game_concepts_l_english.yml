Candidates with greater piety, greater age, greater learning, virtuous traits, secular power, favourable relations with the Pope, and the current culture of Rome/The Pope are preferred. \n\nCandidates are immediately appointed upon the death of a cardinal or upon the accession of one of the nine to the Papacy. \n\nSecular rulers can assign money to the campaign fund of the most promising cardinal candidate in their realm, thus making this vassal bishop more likely to be made into a cardinal."
