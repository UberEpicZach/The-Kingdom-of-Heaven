The perfidious and ungrateful masses have decided, in their infinite wisdom, that the ship of state would be better captained by other hands. Already recreant rats flee the sinking ship, while banners that yesterday proudly flew our favor today bear a very different crest. Very well, then; let the sycophants scurry to curry favor with their new masters; the turn of the pendulum will come again soon enough, and then they will all be reminded in whose hands true power lies.
